       "'On the Prejudices of Philosophers\\n\\n1\\n\\nThe will to truth which will still tempt us to many a venture, that famous truthfulness of which all philosophers so far have spoken with respect - what questions has this will to truth not laid before us! What strange, wicked, questionable questions! That is a long story even now - and yet it seems as if it had scarcely begun. Is it any wonder that we should finally become suspicious, lose patience, and turn away impatiently? that we should finally learn from this Sphinx to ask questions, too? Who is it really that puts questions to us here? What in us really wants \"truth\"?\\n\\nIndeed we came to a long halt at the question about the cause of this will - until we finally came to a complete stop before a still more basic question. We asked about the value of this will. Suppose we want truth: why not rather untruth? and uncertainty? even ignorance?\\n\\nThe problem of the value of truth came before us - or was it we who came before the problem? Who of us is Oedipus here? Who the Sphinx? It is a rendezvous, it seems, of questions and question marks.\\n\\nAnd though it scarcely seems credible, it finally almost seems to us as if the problem had never even been put so far - as if we were the first to see it, fix it with our eyes, and risk it. For it does involve a risk, and perhaps there is none that is greater.\\n\\n2\\n\\n\"How could anything originate out of its opposite? for example, truth out of error? or the will to truth out of the will to deception? or selfless deeds out of selfishness? or the pure and sunlike gaze of the sage out of lust? Such origins are impossible; whoever dreams of them is a fool, indeed worse; the things of highest value must have another, peculiar origin - they cannot be derived from this transitory, seductive, deceptive, paltry world from this turmoil of delusion and lust. Rather from the lap of Being, the intransitory, the hidden god, the \\'thing-in-itself\\' - there must be their basis, and nowhere else.\"\\n\\nThis way of judging constitutes the typical prejudgment and prejudice which give away the metaphysicians of all ages; this kind of valuation looms in the background of all their logical procedures; it is on account of this \"faith\" that they trouble themselves about \"knowledge,\" about something that is finally baptized solemnly as \"the truth.\" The fundamental faith of the metaphysicians is the faith in opposite values. It has not even occurred to the most cautious among them that one might have a doubt right here at the threshold where it was surely most necessary - even if they vowed to themselves, \"de ornnibus dubitandum.\"\\n\\nFor one may doubt, first, whether there are any opposites at all, and secondly whether these popular valuations and opposite values on which the metaphysicians put their seal, are not perhaps merely foreground estimates, only provisional perspectives perhaps even from some nook, perhaps from below, frog perspective as it were, to borrow an expression painters use. For all the value that the true, the truthful, the selfless may deserve, it would still be possible that a higher and more fundamental value for life might have to be ascribed to deception, selfishness, and lust. It might even be possible that what constitutes the value of these good and revered things is precisely that they are insidiously related, tied to and involved with these wicked, seemingly opposite things - maybe even one with them in essence. Maybe!\\n\\nBut who has the will to concern himself with such dangerous maybes? For that, one really has to wait for the advent of a new species of philosophers such as have somehow another and converse taste and propensity from those we have known so far - philosophers of the dangerous \"maybe\" in every sense.\\n\\nAnd in all seriousness: I see such new philosophers coming up.\\n\\n3\\n\\nAfter having looked long enough between the philosopher\\'s lines and fingers, I say to myself: by far the greater part of conscious thinking must still be included among instinctive activities, and that goes even for philosophical thinking. We have to relearn here, as one has had to relearn about heredity and what is \"innate.\" As the act of birth deserves no consideration in the whole process and procedure of heredity, so \"being conscious\" is not in any decisive sense the opposite of what is instinctive: most of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly guided and forced into certain channels by his instincts.\\n\\nBehind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement, too, there stand valuations or, more clearly, physiological demands for the preservation of a certain type of life. For example, that the definite should be worth more than the indefinite, and mere appearance worth less than \"truth\" - such estimates might be, in spite of their regulative importance for us, nevertheless mere foreground estimates, a certain kind of niaiserie which may be necessary for the preservation of just such beings as we are. Supposing, that is, that not just man is the \"measure of things.\"\\n\\n4\\n\\nThe falseness of a judgment is for us not necessarily an objection to a judgment; in this respect our new language may sound strangest. The question is to what extent it is life-promoting, life serving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-cultivating. And we are fundamentally inclined to claim that the falsest judgments (which include the synthetic judgments a priori) are the most indispensable for us; that without accepting the fictions of logic, without measuring reality against the purely invented world of the unconditional and self-identical, without a constant falsification of the world by means of numbers, man could not live - that renouncing false judgments would mean renouncing life and a denial of life. To recognize untruth as a condition of life - that certainly means resisting accustomed value feelings in a dangerous, way; and a philosophy that risks this would by that token alone place itself beyond good and evil.\\n\\n5\\n\\nWhat provokes one to look at all philosophers half suspiciously, half mockingly, is not that one discovers again and again how innocent they are - how often and how easily they make mistakes and go astray; in short, their childishness and childlikeness - but that they are not honest enough in their work, although they make a lot of virtuous noise when the problem of truthfulness is touched even remotely. They all pose as if they had discovered and reached their real opinions through the self-development cold, pure, divinely unconcerned dialectic (as opposed to the mystics of every rank, who are more honest and doltish - and talk of \"inspiration\"); while at bottom it is an assumption, a hunch, indeed a kind of \"inspiration\" - most often a desire of the heart that has been filtered and made abstract - that they defend with reasons they have sought after the fact. They are all advocates who resent that name, and for the most part even wily spokesmen for their prejudices which they baptize \"truths\" - and very far from having the courage of the conscience that admits this, precisely this, to itself; very far from having the good taste of the courage which also lets this be known, whether to warn an enemy or friend, or, from exuberance, to mock itself.\\n\\nThe equally stiff and decorous Tartuffery of the old Kant as he lures us on the dialectical bypaths that lead to his \"categorical imperative\" - really lead astray and seduce - this spectacle makes us smile, as we are fastidious and find it quite amusing to watch closely the subtle tricks of old moralists and preachers of morals. Or consider the hocus-pocus of mathematical form with which Spinoza a clad his philosophy - really \"the love of his wisdom,\" to render that word fairly and squarely - in mail and mask, to strike terror at the very outset into the heart of any assailant who should dare to glance at that invincible maiden and Pallas Athena: how much personal timidity and vulnerability this masquerade of a sick hermit betrays!\\n\\n6\\n\\nGradually it has become clear to me what every great philosophy so far has been - namely, the personal confession of its author and a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir; also that the moral (or immoral) intentions in every philosophy constituted the real germ of life from which the whole plant had grown.\\n\\nIndeed, if one would explain how the abstrusest metaphysical claims of a philosopher really came about, it is always well (and wise) to ask first: at what morality does all this (does he) aim? According, I do not believe that a \"drive to knowledge\" is the father of philosophy; but rather that another drive has, here as elsewhere employed understanding (and misunderstanding) as a mere instrument. But anyone who considers the basic drives of man to see to what extent they may have been at play just here as in inspiring spirits (or demons and kobolds) will find that all of them have done philosophy at some time - and that every single one of them would like only too well to represent just itself as the ultimate purpose of existence and the legitimate master of all the other drives. For every drive wants to be master - and it attempts to philosophize in that spirit.\\n\\nTo be sure: among scholars who are really scientific men things may be different -\"better,\" if you like - there you may really find something like a drive for knowledge, some small independent clockwork that, once well wound, works on vigorously without any essential participation from all the other drives of the scholar. The real \"interests\" of the scholar therefore lie usually somewhere else - say, in his family, or in making money, or in politics. Indeed, it is almost a matter of total indifference whether his little machine is placed at this or that spot in science, and whether the \"promising\" young worker turns himself into a good philologist or an expert on fungi or a chemist: it does not characterize him that he becomes this or that. In the philosopher conversely, there is nothing whatever that is impersonal; and above all his morality bears decided and decisive witness to who he is - that is, in what order of rank the innermost drives of his nature stand in relation to each other.\\n\\n7\\n\\nHow malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more venomous than the joke Epicurus permitted himself against Plato and the Platonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes. That means literally - and this is the foreground meaning -\"flatterers of Dionysius,\" in other words, tyrant\\'s baggage and lickspittles; but addition to this he also wants to say, \"they are all actors, there is nothing genuine about them\" (for Dionysokolax was a popular name for an actor). And the latter is really the malice that Epicurus aimed at Plato: he was peeved by the grandiose manner, the mise en scene at which Plato and his disciples were so expert - at which Epicurus was not an expert - he, that old schoolmaster from Samos who sat, hidden away, in his little garden at Athens and wrote three hundred books - who knows? perhaps from rage and ambition against Plato?\\n\\nIt took a hundred years until Greece found out who this garden god, Epicurus, had been - did they find out?\\n\\n8\\n\\nThere is a point in every philosophy when the philosopher\\'s \"conviction\" appears on the stage - or to use the language of an ancient Mystery:\\n\\nAdventavit asinus, Pulcher et fortissimus.\\n\\n9\\n\\n\"According to nature\" you want to live? O you noble Stoics, what deceptive words these are! Imagine a being like nature, wasteful beyond measure, indifferent beyond measure, without purposes and consideration, without mercy and justice, fertile and desolate and uncertain at the same time; imagine indifference itself as a power - how could you live according to this indifference? Is that not precisely wanting to be other than this nature? Is not living - estimating, preferring, being unjust, being limited - wanting to be different? And supposing your imperative \"live according to nature\" meant at bottom as much as \"live according to life\" how could you not do that? Why make a principle of what you yourselves are and must be?\\n\\nIn truth, the matter is altogether different: while you pretend rapturously to read the canon of your law in nature, you want something opposite, you strange actors and self-deceivers! Your pride wants to impose your morality, your ideal, on nature - even on nature - and incorporate them in her; you demand that she be nature \"according to the Stoa,\" and you would like all existence to exist only after your own image - as an immense eternal glorification and generalization of Stoicism. For all your love of truth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, so rigidly-hypnotically to see nature the wrong way, namely Stoically, that you are no longer able to see her differently. And some abysmal arrogance finally still inspires you with the insane hope that because you know how to tyrannize yourselves - Stoicism is self tyranny - nature, too, lets herself be tyrannized: is not the Stoic - a piece of nature?\\n\\nBut this is an ancient, eternal story: what formerly happened with the Stoics still happens today, too, as soon as any philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise. Philosophy is this tyrannical drive itself, the most spiritual will to power, to the \"creation of the world,\" to the causa prima.\\n\\n10\\n\\nThe eagerness and subtlety-I might even say, shrewdness- with which the problem of \"the real and the apparent world\" is to day attacked all over Europe makes one think and wonder; and anyone who hears nothing in the background except a \"will to truth,\" certainly does not have the best of ears. In rare and isolate instances it may really be the case that such a will to truth, some extravagant and adventurous courage, a metaphysician\\'s ambition to hold a hopeless position, may participate and ultimately prefer even a handful of \"certainty\" to a whole carload of beautiful possibilities; there may actually be puritanical fanatics of conscience who prefer even a certain nothing to an uncertain something to lie down on - and die. But this is nihilism and the sign of a despairing, mortally weary soul - however courageous the gestures of such a virtue may look.\\n\\nIt seems, however, to be otherwise with stronger and livelier thinkers who are still eager for life. When they side against appearance, and speak of \"perspective,\" with a new arrogance; when they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the credibility of the visual evidence that \"the earth stands still,\" and thus, apparently in good humor, let their securest possession go (for in what does one at present believe more firmly than in one\\'s body?) -who knows if they are not trying at bottom to win back something that was formerly an even securer possession, something of the ancient domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the \"immortal soul,\" perhaps \"the old God,\" in short, ideas by which one could live better, that is to say, more vigorously and cheerfully than by \"modern ideas\"? There is mistrust of these modern ideas in this attitude, a disbelief in all that has been constructed yesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety and scorn, unable to endure any longer the bric-a-brac of concepts of the most diverse origin, which is the form in which so-called positivism offers itself on the market today; a disgust of the more fastidious taste at the village-fair motleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters in whom there is nothing new or genuine, except this motleyness. In this, it seems to me, we should agree with these skeptical anti-realists and knowledge microscopists of today: their instinct, which repels them from modern reality, is unrefuted - what do their retrograde bypaths concern us! The main thing about them is not that they wish to go back, but that they wish to get - away. A little more strength, flight, courage, and artistic power. and they would want to rise - not return!\\n\\n11\\n\\nlt seems to me that today attempts are made everywhere to diver attention from the actual influence Kant exerted on German philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value he set upon himself. Kant was first and foremost proud of his table of categories; with that in his hand he said: \"This is the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\"\\n\\nLet us only understand this \"could be\"! He was proud of having discovered a new faculty in man, the faculty for synthetic judgments a priori. Suppose he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid flourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, and on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover, if possible, something still prouder - at all events \"new faculties\"!\\n\\nBut let us reflect; it is high time to do so. \"How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?\" Kant asked himself - and what really is his answer? \"By virtue of a faculty\" but unfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, venerably, and with such a display of German profundity and curlicues that people simply failed to note the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer. People were actually beside themselves with delight over this new faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant further discovered a moral faculty in man - for at that time the Germans were still moral and not yet addicted to Realpolitik.\\n\\nThe honeymoon of German philosophy arrived. All the young theologians of the Tubingen seminary went into the bushes - all looking for \"faculties.\" And what did they not find - in that innocent, rich, and still youthful period of the German spirit, to which romanticism, the malignant fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish between \"finding\" and \"inventing\"! Above all, a faculty for the \"surprasensible\": Schelling christened it intellectual intuition, and thus gratified the most heartfelt cravings of the Germans, whose cravings were at bottom pious. One can do no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and enthushiastic movement, which was really youthfulness, however boldly it disguised itself in hoary and senile concepts, than to take it seriously or worse, to treat it with moral indignation. Enough, one grew older and the dream vanished. A time came when people scratched their heads, and they still scratch them today. One had been dreaming, and first and foremost - old Kant. \"By virtue of a faculty\" - he had said, or at least meant. But is that an answer? An explanation? Or is it not rather merely a repetition of the question? How does opium induce sleep? \"By virtue of a faculty,\" namely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in Moliere,\\n\\nQuia est in eo virtus dormitiva, Cujus est natura sensus assoupire.\\n\\nBut such replies belong in comedy, and it is high time to replace the Kantian question, \"How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?\" by another question, \"Why is belief in such judgments necassary?\" - and to comprehend that such judgments must be believed to be true, for the sake of the preservation of creatures like ourselves; though they might, of course, be false judgments for all that! Or to speak more clearly and coarsely: synthetic judgments a priori should not \"be possible\" at all; we have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false judgments. Only, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as a foreground belief and visual evidence belonging to the perspective optics of life.\\n\\nFinally, to call to mind the enormous influence that \"German philosophy\" - I hope you understand its right to quotation marks - has exercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is no doubt that a certain virtus dormitiva had a share in it: it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous, the mystics, artists, three-quarter Christians, and political obscurantists of all nations, to find, thanks to German philosophy, an antidote to the still predominant sensualism which overflowed from the last century into this, in short - \"sensus assoupire.\"\\n\\n12\\n\\nAs for materialistic atomism, it is one of the best refuted theories there are, and in Europe perhaps no one in the learned world is now so unscholarly as to attach serious significance to it for convenient household use (as an abbreviation of the means of expression) thanks chiefly to the Dalmatian Boscovich and the Pole Corpernicus have been the greatest and most successful opponents of visual evidence so far. For while Copernicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth does not stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the last part of the earth that \"stood fast\" - the belief in substance,\" in \"matter,\" in the earth-residuum and particle-atom; it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has been gained on earth so far.\\n\\nOne must, however, go still further. and also declare war, relentless war unto death, against the \"atomistic need\" which still leads a dangerous afterlife in places where no one suspects it, just like the more celebrated \"metaphysical need\": one must also, first of all, give the finishing stroke to that other and more calamitous atomism which Christianity has taught best and longest, the soul atomism. Let it be permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the soul as something indestructible. eternal, in divisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science! Between ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of \"the soul\" at the same time, and thus to renounce one of the most ancient and venerable hypotheses - as happens frequently to clumsy naturalists who can hardly touch on \"the soul\" without immediately losing it. But the way is open for new versions and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions as \"mortal soul,\" and \"soul as subjective multiplicity,\" and \\'\\'soul as social structure of the drives and affects want henceforth to have citizens\\' rights in science. When the new psychologist puts an end to the superstitions which have so far flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of the soul, he practically exiles himself into a new desert and a new suspicion - it is possible that the older psychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually, however, he finds that precisely thereby he also concerns himself to invention - and - who knows? - perhaps to discovery.\\n\\n13\\n\\nPhysiologists should think before putting down the instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being. A living thing seeks above all to discharge its strength - life itself is will to power; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent results.\\n\\nIn short, here as everywhere else, let us beware of superfluous teleological principles - one of which is the instinct of self preservation (we owe it to Spinoza\\'s inconsistency). Thus method, which must be essentially economy of principles, demands it.\\n\\n14\\n\\nIt is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that physics, too, is only an interpretation and exegesis of the world (to suit us, if I may say so!) and not a world-explanation; but insofar as it is based on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a long time to come must be regarded as more - namely, as an explanation. Eyes and fingers speak in its favor, visual evidence and palpableness do, too: this strikes an age with fundamentally plebian tastes as fascinating, persuasive, and convincing - after all, it follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternally popular sensualism. What is clear, what is \"explained\"? Only what can be seen and felt - every problem has to be pursued to that point. Conversely, the charm of the Platonic way of thinking, which was a noble way of thinking, consisted precisely in resistance to obvious sense-evidence - perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more demanding senses than our contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of their senses - and this by means of pale, cold, gray concept nets which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses - the mob of the senses, as Plato said. In this overcoming of the world and interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato, there was an enjoyment different from that which the physicists of today offer us - and also the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the workers in physiology, with their principle of the \"smallest possible force\" and the greatest possible stupidity. \"Where man cannot find anything to see or to grasp, he has no further business\" - that is certainly an imperative different from the Platonic one, but it may be the right imperative for a tough, industrious race of machinists and bridge-builders of the future, who have nothing but rough work to do.\\n\\n15\\n\\nTo study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist that the sense organs are not phenomena in the sense of idealistic philosophy; as such they could not be causes! Sensualism, therefore, at least as a regulative hypothesis, if not as a heuristic principle.\\n\\nWhat? And others even say that the external world is the work of our organs? But then our body, as a part of this external world, would be the work of our organs! But then our organs themselves would be the work of our organs! It seems to me that this is a complete reductio ad absurdum - assuming that the concept of a causa sui is something fundamentally absurd. Consequently, the external world is just the work of our organs - ?\\n\\n16\\n\\nThere are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are \"immediate certainties\"; for example, \"I think,\" or as the superstition of Schopenhauer put it, \"I will\"; as though knowledge here got hold of its object purely and nakedly as \"the thing in it self\" without any falsification on the part of either the subject or the object. But that \"immediate certainty,\" as well as \"absolute knowledge\" and the \"thing in itself,\" involve a contradictio adjecto. I shall repeat a hundred times; we really ought to free our selves from the seduction of words!\\n\\nLet the people suppose that knowledge means knowing things entirely; the philosopher must say to himself: When I analyze the process that is expressed in the sentence, \"I think,\" I find a whole series of daring assertions that would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to prove; for example, that it is I who think, that there must neccssarily be something that thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is an \"ego,\" and, finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated by thinking - that I know what thinking is. For if I had not already decided within myself what it is, by what standard could I determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps \"willing\" or \"feeling\"? In short, the assertion \"I think\" assumes that I compare my state at the present moment with other states of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection with further \"knowledge,\" it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for me.\\n\\nIn place of the \"immediate certainty\" in which the people may believe in the case at hand, the philosopher thus finds a series of metaphysical questions presented to him, truly searching questions of the intellect; to wit: \"From where do I get the concept of thing? Why do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right to speak of an ego, and even of an ego as cause, and finally ego as the cause of thought?\" Whoever ventures to answer the metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a sort of intuitive perception, like the person who says, \"I think, and know that at least, is true, actual, and certain\" - will encounter a smile and two question marks from a philosopher nowadays. \"Sir,\" the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand, \"it is improbable that you are not mistaken; but why insist on the truth?\"\\n\\n17\\n\\nWith regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never tire of emphasizing a small terse fact, which these superstitious minds hate to concede - namely, that a thought comes when \"it\" wishes. and not when \"I\" wish, so that it is a falsification of the facts of the case to say that the subject \"I\" is the condition of the predicate \"think.\" It thinks; but that this \"it\" is precisely the famous old \"ego\" is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion. and assuredly not an \"immediate certainty.\" After all, one has even gone too far with this \"it thinks\" - even the \"it\" contains an interpretation of the process, and does not belong to the process itself. 0ne infers here according to the grammatical habit: \"Thinking is an activity; every activity requires an agent; consequently...\"\\n\\nIt was pretty much according to the same schema that the older atomism sought, besides the operating \"power,\" that lump of matter in which it resides and out of which it operates - the atom. More rigorous minds, however, learned at last to get along without this \"earth-residuum,\" and perhaps some day we shall accustom ourselves, including the logicians, to get along without the little \"it\" (which is all that is left of the honest little old ego).\\n\\n18\\n\\nIt is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts subtler minds. It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of a \"free will\" owes its persistence to this charm alone; again and again someone comes along who feels he is strong enough to refute it.\\n\\n19\\n\\nPhilosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as if it were the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us to understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and completely known, without subtraction or addition. But again and again it seems to me that in this case, too, Schopenhauer only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing - he adopted a popular prejudice and exaggerated it. Willing seems to me to be above all something complicated, something that is a unit only as a word - and it is precisely in this one word that the popular prejudice lurks, which has defeated the always inadequate caution of philosophers. So let us for once be more cautious, let us be \"unphilosophical\": let us say that in all willing there is, first, a plurality of sensations, namely, the sensation of the state \"away from which\" the sensation of the state \"towards which,\" the sensation of this \"from and towards\" themselves, and then also an accompanying muscular sensation, which, even without our putting into motion \"arms and legs,\" begins its action by force of habit as soon as we \"will\" anything.\\n\\nTherefore just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensation) are to be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, secondly, should thinking also: in every act of the will there is a ruling thought - let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from the \"willing,\" as if any will would then remain over!\\n\\nThird, the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking, but it is above all an affect, and specifically the affect of the command. That which is termed \"freedom of the will\" is essentially the affect of superiority in relation to him who must obey: \"I am free, \\'he\\' must obey\" - this consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally so the straining of the attention, the straight look that fixes itself exclusively on one aim, the unconditional evaluation that \"thls and nothing else is necessary now,\" the inward certainty that obedience will be rendered - and whatever else belongs to the position of the commander. A man who wills commands something within himself that renders obedience, or that he believes renders obedience.\\n\\nBut now let us notice what is strangest about the will - this manifold thing for which the people have only one word: inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding and the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance and motion, which usually begin immediately after the act of will, inasmuch as, on the other hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive ourselves about it by means of thc synthetic concept \"I,\" a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false evaluations of the will itself, has become attached to the act of willing - to such a degree that he who wills believes sincerely that willing suffices for action. Since in thc great majority of cases there has been exereise of will only when the effect of the command - that is, obedience; that is, the action - was to be expected, the appearance has translated itself into the feeling, as if there were a necessity of effect. In short, he who wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing, to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success.\\n\\n\"Freedom of the will\" - that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order - who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his will itself that overcame them. In this way the person exercising volition adds the feeling of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful \"under-wills\" or under-souls - indeed, our body is but a social structure composed of many souls - to his feelings of delight as commander L\\'effet c\\'est moi: what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed and happy commonwealth; namely, the governing class identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as already said, of a social structure composed of many \"souls.\" Hence a philosopher should claim the right to include willomg as such within the sphere of morals - morals being understood as the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phemenon of \"life\" comes to be.\\n\\n20\\n\\nThat individual philosophical concepts are not anything capricious or autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and reltionship with each other; that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to a system as all the members of the fauna of a continent - is betrayed in the end also by the fact that the most diverse philosophers keep filling in a definite fundamental scheme of possible philosophies. Under an invisible spell, they always revolve once more in the same orbit; however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something within them leads them, something impels them in a definite order, one after the other - to wit, the innate systematic structure and relationship of their concepts. Their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a recognition, a remembering, a return and a homecoming to a remote, primordial, an inclusive houschold of the soul, out of which those concepts grew originall: philosophizing is to this extent a kind of atavism of the highest order.\\n\\nThe strange family resemblance of all lndian, Greck, and German philosophizing is explained easily enough. Where there is affinity of languages, it cannot fail, owing to the common philosophy of grammar - I mean, owing to the unconscious domination and guidance by similar grammatical functions - that everything is prepared at the outset for a similar development and sequence of philosophical systems; just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of world-interpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers wlthin the domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the concept of the subject is least developed) look otherwise \"into the world,\" and will be found on paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germanic peoples and the Muslims: the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately also the spell of physiological valuations and racial conditions.\\n\\nSo much by way of rejecting Locke\\'s superficiality regardinh the origin of ideas.\\n\\n21\\n\\nThe causa sui is the best self-contradiction that has been conceived so far, it is a sort of rape and perversion of logic; but the extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with just this nonsense. The desire for \"free dom of the will\" in the superlative metaphysical sense, which still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated; the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one\\'s actions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society involves nothing less than to be precisely this causa sui and, with more than Munchhausen\\'s audacity, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the swamps of nothingness. Suppose someone were thus to see through the boorish simplicity of this celebrated concept of \"free will\" and put it out of his head altogether, l beg of him to carry his \"enlightenment\" a step further, and so put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception of \"free will\": I mean \"unfree will,\" which amounts to a misuse of cause and effect. One should not wrongly reify \"cause\" and \"effect\" as the natural scientists do (and whoever, like them, now \"naturalizes\" in his thinking), according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it \"effects\" its end; one should use \"cause\" and \"effect\" only as pure concepts, that is to say, as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and communication - not for explanation. In the \"in itself\" there is nothing of \"causal connections,\" of \"necessity,\" or of \"psychological non-freedom\"; there the effect does not follow the cause, there is no rule of \"law.\" It is we alone who have devised cause, sequence, for-each-other, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive, and purpose; and when we project and mix this symbol world into things as if it existed \"in itself,\" we act once more as we have always acted - mythologically. The \"unfree will\" is mythology; in real life it is only a matter of strong and weak wills.\\n\\nlt is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker senses in every \"causal connection\" and \"psychological necessity\" something of constraint, need, compulsion to obey, pressure, and unfreedom; it is suspicious to have such feelings - that person betrays himself. And in general, if I have observed correctly, the \"unfreedom of the will\" is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly personal manner: some will not give up their \"responsibility,\" their belief in themselves, the personal right to their merits at any price (the vain races belong to this class). Others, on the contrary, do not wish to be answerable for anything, or blamed for anything, and owing to an inward self-contempt, seek to lay the blame for them selves somewhere else. The latter, when they write books, are in the habit today of taking the side of criminals; a sort of socialist pity is thelr most attractive disguise. And as a matter of fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisingly when it can pose as \"la religion de la souffrance humaine\"; that is its \"good taste.\"\\n\\n22\\n\\nForgive me as an old philologist who cannot desist from the malice of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation: but \"nature\\'s conformity to law,\" of which you physicists talk so proudly as though - why, it exists only owing to your interpretion and bad \"philology.\" It is no matter of fact, no \"text,\" but rather only a naively humanitarian emendation and perversion of meaning, with which you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern soul! \"Everywhere equality bcfore the law; nature is no different in that respect, no better off than we are\" - a fine instance of ulterior motivation, in which the plebian antagonism to everything privileged and autocratic as well as a second and more refined atheism are disguised once more. \"Ni Dieu, ni maltre\" - that is what you, too, want; and therefore \"cheers for the law of nature!\" - is it not so? But as said above, that is interpretation, not text; and somebody might come along who, with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation, could read out of the same \"nature\" and with regard to the same phenomena rather the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of claims of power - an interpreter who would picture the unexceptional and unconditional aspects of all \"will to power\" so vividly that almost every word, even the word \"tyranny\" itself, would eventually sound unsuitable, or a weakening and attenuating metaphor -being too human - but he might, nevertheless, end by asserting the same about this world as you do, namely, that it has a \"necessary\\'\\' and \"calculable\" course, not because laws obtain in it, but because they are absolutely lacking, and every power draws its ultimate consequences at every moment. Supposing that this also is only interpreation - and you will be eager enough to make this objection - well sp much the better.\\n\\n23\\n\\nAll psychology so far has got stuck in moral prejudices and fears; it has not dared to descend into the depths. To understand it as morphology and the doctrine of the development of the will to power, as I do - nobody has yet come close to doing this even in thought - insofar as it is permissible to recognize in what has been written so far a symptom of what has so far been kept silent. The power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most spiritual world, which would seem to be the coldest and most devoid of presuppositions, and has obviously operated in an injurious, inhibiting, blinding, and distorting manner. A proper physio-psychology has to contend with unconscious resistance in the heart of the investigator, it has \"the heart\" against it: even a doctrine of thc reciprocal dependence of the \"good\\' and the \"wicked\\' drives, causes (as refined immorality) distress and aversion in a still hale and hearty conscience - still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of good impulses from wicked ones. If, however, a person should regard even the affects of hatred, envy, covetousness, and the lust to rule as conditions of life, as factors which, fundamcntally and essentially must be present in the general cconomy of life (and must, there, be further enhanced if life is to be further enhanced) - he will suffer from such a view of things as from seasickness. And yet even this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous insights; and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why everyone should keep away from it who - can.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if one has once drifted there with one\\'s bark, well! all right! let us clench our teeth! let us open our eyes and keep our hand firm on the helm! We sail right over morality, we crush, we destroy perhaps the remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage there - but what matter are we! Never yet did a profounder world of insight reveal itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the psychologist who thus \"makes a sacrifice\" - it is not the sacrifizio dell\\' intelletto, on the contrary! - will at least be entitled to demand in return that psychology shall be recognized again as the queen of the sciences, for whose service and preparation the other sciences exist. For psychology is now again the path to the fundamental problems.\\n\\n\\nThe Free Spirit\\n\\n24\\n\\nO sancta simplicitas! In what strange simplification and falsification man lives! One can never cease wondering once one has acquired eyes for this marvel! How we have made everything around us clear and free and easy and simple! how we have been able to give our senses a passport to everything superficial, our thoughts a divine desire for wanton leaps and wrong inferences! how from the beginning we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost inconceivable freedom, lack of scruple and caution, heartiness, and gaiety of life - in order to enjoy life! And only on this now solid, granite foundation of ignorance could knowledge rise so far - the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful will: the will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue! Not as its opposite, but as its refinement! Even if language, here as elsewhere, will not get over its awkwardness, and will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees and many subtleties of gradation; even if the inveterate Tartuffery of morals, which now belongs to our unconquerable \"flesh and blood,\" infects the words even of those of us who know better - here and there we understand it and laugh at the way in which precisely science at its best seeks most to keep us in this simplified, thoroughly artificial, suitably constructed and suitably falsified world - at the way in which, willy-nilly, it loves error, because, being alive, it loves life.\\n\\n25\\n\\nAfter such a cheerful commencement, a serious word would like to be heard; it appeals to the most serious. Take care, philosophers and friends, of knowledge, and beware of martyrdom! Of suffering \"for the truth\\'s sake\"! Even of defending yourselves! spoils all the innocence and fine neutrality of your conscience; makes you headstrong against objections and red rags; it stupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes when in the struggle with danger, slander, suspicion, expulsion, and even worse consequences of hostility, you have to pose as protectors of truth upon earth - as though \"the truth\" were such an innocuous and incompetent creature as to require protectors! and you of all people, you knights of the most sorrowful countenances dear loafers and cobweb-spinners of the spirit! After all, you know well enough that it cannot be of any con. sequence if you of all people are proved right; you know that no philosopher so far has been proved right, and that there might be a more laudable truthfulness in every little question mark that you place after your special words and favorite doctrines (and occasionally after yourselves) than in all the solemn gestures and trumps before accusers and law courts. Rather, go away. Flee into concealment. And have your masks and subtlety, that you ma mistaken for what you are not, or feared a little. And don\\'t the garden, the garden with golden trelliswork. And have around you who are as a garden - or as music on the waters evening, when the day is turning into memories. Choose the solitude, the free, playful, light solitude that gives you, too, the right, to remain good in some sense. How poisonous, how crafty, hot bad, does every long war make one, that cannot be waged open] by means of force! How personal does a long fear make one, long watching of enemies, of possible enemies! These outcasts society, these long-pursued, wickedly persecuted ones - also compulsory recluses, the Spinozas or Giordano Brunos always come in the end, even under the most spiritual masquerade, perhaps without being themselves aware of it, sophisticated vengeance-seekers and poison-brewers (let someone lay bare the foundation of Spinoza\\'s ethics and theology!), not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation, which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that his philosophical sense of humor has left him. The martyrdom of the philosopher, his \"sacrifice for the sake of truth,\" forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him; and if one has so far contemplated him only with artistic curiosity, with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous desire to see him also in his degeneration (degenerated into a \"martyr,\" into a stage- and platform-bawler). Only, that it is necessary with such a desire to be clear what spectacle one will see in any case - merely a satyr play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the continued proof that the long, real tragedy is at an end, assuming that every philosophy was in its genesis a long tragedy.\\n\\n26\\n\\nEvery choice human being strives instinctively for a citadel and a secrecy where he is saved from the crowd, the many, the great majority - where he may forget \"men who are the rule,\" being their exception - excepting only the one case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct, as a seeker after knowledge in the great and exceptional sense. Anyone who, in intercourse with men, does not occasionally glisten in all the colors of distress, green and gray with disgust, satiety, sympathy, gloominess, and loneliness, is certainly not a man of elevated tastes; supposing, however, that he does not take all this burden and disgust upon himself voluntarily, that he persistently avoids it, and remains, as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is certain: he was not made, he was not predestined, for knowledge. If he were, he would one day have to say to himself: \"The devil take my good taste! but the rule is more interesting than the exception - than myself, the exception!\" And be would go down and above all, he would go \"inside.\" The long and serious study of the average man, and consequently much disguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad contact (all contact is bad contact except with one\\'s equals) - this constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every philosopher, perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and disappointing part. If he is fortunate, however, as a favorite child of knowledge should be, he will encounter suitable shortcuts and helps for his task; I mean so-called cynics, those who simply recognize the animal, the commonplace, and \"the rule\" in themselves, and at the same time still have that degree of spirituality and that itch which makes them talk of themselves and their likes before witnesses - sometimes they even wallow in books, as on their own dung. Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach honesty; and the higher man must listen closely to every coarse or subtle cynicism, and congratulate himself when a clown without shame or a scientific satyr speaks out precisely in front of him. There are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgust - namely, where by a freak of nature genius is tied to some such indiscreet billygoat and ape, as in the case of the Abbe Galiani, the profoundest, most clear-sighted, and perhaps also filthiest man of his century - he was far profounder than Voltaire and consequently also a good deal more taciturn. It happens more frequently, as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed on an ape\\'s body, a subtle exceptional understanding in a base soul, an occurrence by no means rare, especially among doctors and physiologists of morality. And whenever anyone speaks without bitterness, quite innocently, of man as a belly with two requirements, and a head with one; whenever anyone sees, seeks, and wants to see only hunger, sexual lust, and vanity as the real and only motives of human actions; in short, when anyone speaks \"badly\" and not even \"wickedly\" of man, the lover of knowledge should listen subtly land diligently; he should altogether have an open ear wherever people talk without indignation. For the indignant and Whoever perpetually tears and lacerates with his own teeth himself (or as a substitute, the world, or God, or society) may indeed, morally speaking, stand higher than the laughing and self-satisfied satyr, but in every other sense they are a more ordinary, more indifferent, and less instructive case. And no one lies as much as the indignant do.\\n\\n27\\n\\nIt is hard to be understood, especially when one thinks and lives gangasrotagati among men who think and live differently namely, kurmagati, or at best \"the way frogs walk,\" mandukagati (I obviously do everything to be \"hard to understan \"; myself!) - and one should be cordially grateful for the good will to some subtlety of interpretation. As regards \"the good friends,\" however, who are always too lazy and think that as friends they have a right to relax, one does well to grant them from the outset some leeway and romping place for misunderstanding: then on can even laugh - or get rid of them altogether, these good friends - and also laugh.\\n\\n28\\n\\nWhat is most difficult to render from one language into an other is the tempo of its style, which has its basis in the character of the race, or to speak more physiologically, in the average temp of its metabolism. There are honestly meant translations that, a involuntary vulgarizations, are almost falsifications of the original merely because its bold and merry tempo (which leaps over an obviates all dangers in things and words) could not be translates A German is almost incapable of presto in his language; thus also as may be reasonably inferred, of many of the most delightful and daring nuances of free, free-spirited thought. And just as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience, so Aristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him. Everything ponderous, viscous, and solemnly clumsy, all long-winded and boring types of style are developed in profuse variety among German - forgive me the fact that even Goethe\\'s prose, in its mixture o stiffness and elegance, is no exception, being a reflection of the \"good old time\" to which it belongs, and a reflection of German taste at a time when there still was a \"German taste\" - a rococo taste in moribus et artibus. Lessing is an exception, owing to his histrionic nature which understood much and understood how to do many things. He was not the translator of Bayle for nothing and liked to flee to the neighborhood of Diderot and Voltaire, and better yet - that of the Roman comedy writers. In tempo, too, Lessing loved free thinking and escape from Germany. But how could the German language, even in the prose of a Lessing, imitate the tempo of Machiavelli, who in his Principe [The Prince] lets us breathe the dry, refined air of Florence and cannot help presenting the most serious matters in a boisterous allegrissimo, perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he risks - long, difficult, hard, dangerous thoughts and the tempo of the gallop and the very best, most capricious humor? Who, finally, could venture on a German translation of Petronius, who, more than any great musician so far, was a master of presto in invention, ideas, and words? What do the swamps of the sick, wicked world, even the \"ancient world,\" matter in the end, when one has the feet of a wind as he did, the rush, the breath, the liberating scorn of a wind that makes everything healthy by making everything run! And as for Aristopbanes - that transfiguring, complementary spirit for whose sake one forgives everything Hellenic for having existed, provided one has understood in its full profundity all that needs to be forgiven and transfigured here - there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on PlatiYs secrecy and sphinx nature than the happily preserved petit fait that under the pillow of his deathbed there was found no \"Bible,\" nor anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonic - but a volume of Aristophanes. How could even Plato have endured life - a Greek life he repudiated - without an Aristophanes?\\n\\n29\\n\\nIndependence is for the very few; it is a privilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it even with the best right but without inner constraint proves that he is probably not only strong, but also daring to the point of recklessness. He enters into a labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life brings with it in any case, not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way, becomes lonely, and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing one like that comes to grief, this happens so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it nor sympathize. And he cannot go back any longer. Nor can he go back to the pity of men.\\n\\n30\\n\\nOur highest insights must - and should - sound like follies and sometimes like crimes when they are heard without permission by those who are not predisposed and predestined for them. The difference between the exoteric and the esoteric, formerly known to philosophers - among the Indians as among the Greeks, Persians, and Muslims, in short, wherever one believed in an order of rank and not in equality and equal rights - does not so much consist in this, that the exoteric approach comes from outside and sees, estimates, measures, and judges from the outside, not the inside: what is much more essential is that the exoteric approach sees things from below, the esoteric looks down from above. There are heights of the soul from which even tragedy ceases to look tragic; and rolling together all the woe of the world - who could dare to decide whether its sight would necessarily seduce us and compel us to feel pity and thus double this woe? What serves the higher type of men as nourishment or delectation must almost be poison for a very different and inferior type. The virtues of the common man might perhaps signify vices and weaknesses in a philosopher. It could be possible that a man of a high type, when degenerating and perishing, might only at that point acquire qualities that would require those in the lower sphere into which he had sunk to begin to venerate him like a saint. There are books that have opposite values for soul and health, depending on whether the lower soul, the lower vitality, or the higher and more vigorous ones turn to them: in the former case, these books are dangerous and lead to crumbling and disintegration; in the latter, heralds\\' cries that call the bravest to their courage. Books for all the world are always foul-smelling books: the smell of small people clings to them. Where the people eat and drink, even where they venerate, it usually stinks. One should not go to church if one wants to breathe pure air.\\n\\n31\\n\\nWhen one is young, one venerates and - despises without that art of nuances which constitutes the best gain of life, and it is only fair that one has to pay dearly for having assaulted men and things in this manner with Yes and No. Everything is arranged so that the worst of tastes, the taste for the unconditional, should be cruelly fooled and abused until a man learns to put a little art into his feelings and rather to risk trying even what is artificial - as the real artists of life do. The wrathful and reverent attitudes characteristic of youth do not seem to permit themselves any rest until they have forged men and things in such a way that these attitudes may be vented on them - after all, youth in itself has something of forgery and deception. Later, when the young soul, tortured by all kinds of disappointments\\', finally turns suspiciously against itself, still hot and wild, even in its suspicion and pangs of conscience - how wroth it is with itself now! how it tears itself to pieces, impatiently! how it takes revenge for its long self-delusion, just as if it had been a deliberate blindness! In this transition one punishes oneself with mistrust against one\\'s own feelings; one tortures one\\'s own enthusiasm with doubts; indeed, one experiences even a good conscience as a danger, as if it were a way of wrapping oneself in veils and the exhaustion of subtler honesty - and above all one takes sides, takes sides on principle, against \"youth.\" Ten years later one comprehends that all this, too - was still youth.\\n\\n32\\n\\nDuring the longest part of human history - so-called prehistorical times - the value or disvalue of an action was derived from its consequences. The action itself was considered as little as its origin. It was rather the way a distinction or disgrace still reaches back today from a child to its parents, in China: it was the retroactive force of success or failure that led men to think well or ill of an action. Let us call this period the pre-moral period of mankind: the imperative \"know thyself!\" was as yet unknown. In the last ten thousand years, however, one has reached the point, step by step, in a few large regions on the earth, where it is no longer the consequences but the origin of an action that one allows to decide its value. On the whole this is a great event which involves a considerable refinement of vision and standards; it is the unconscious aftereffect of the rule of aristocratic values and the faith in \"descent\" - the sign of a period that one may call moral in the narrower sense. It involves the first attempt at self-knowledge. Instead of the consequences, the origin: indeed a reversal of perspective! Surely, a reversal achieved only after long struggles and vacillations. To be sure, a calamitous new superstition, an odd narrowness of interpretation, thus become dominant: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite sense as origin in an intention; one came to agree that the value of an action lay in the value of the intention. The intention as the whole origin and prehistory of an action - almost to the present day this prejudice dominated moral praise, blame, judgment, and philosophy on earth. But today - shouldn\\'t we have reached the necessity of once more resolving on a reversal and fundamental shift in values, owing to another self-examination of man, another growth in profundity? Don\\'t we stand at the threshold of a period which should be designated negatively, to begin with, as extra-moral? After all, today at least we immoralists have the suspicion that the decisive value of an action lies precisely in what is unintentional in it, while everything about it that is intentional, everything about it that can be seen, known, \"conscious,\" still belongs to its surface and skin - which, like every skin, betrays something but conceals even more. In short, we believe that the intention is merely a sign and symptom that still requires interpretation - moreover, a sign that means too much and therefore, taken by itself alone, almost nothing. We believe that morality in the traditional sense, the morality of intentions, was a prejudice, precipitate and perhaps provisional - something on the order of astrology and alchemy - but in any case something that must be overcome. The overcoming of morality, in a certain sense even the self-overcoming of morality - let this be the name for that long secret work which has been saved up for the finest and most honest, also the most malicious, consciences of today, as living touchstones of the soul.\\n\\n33\\n\\nThere is no other way: the feelings of devotion, self-sacrifice for one\\'s neighbor, the whole morality of self-denial must be questioned mercilessly and taken to court - no less than the aesthetics of \"contemplation devoid of all interest\" which is used today as a seductive guise for the emasculation of art, to give it a good conscience. There is too much charm and sugar in these feelings of \"for others,\" \"not for myself,\" for us not to need to become doubly suspicious at this point and to ask: \"are these not perhaps - seductions?\" That they please those who have them and those who enjoy their fruits, and also the mere spectator - this does not yet constitute an argument in their favor but rather invites caution. So let us be cautious.\\n\\n34\\n\\nWhatever philosophical standpoint one may adopt today, from every point of view the erroneousness of the world in which we think we live is the surest and firmest fact that we can lay eyes on: we find reasons upon reasons for it which would like to lure us to hypotheses concerning a deceptive principle in \"the essence of things.\" But whoever holds our thinking itself, \"the spirit,\" in other words, responsible for the falseness of the world - an honorable way out which is chosen by every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei - whoever takes this world, along with space, time, form, movement, to be falsely inferred - anyone like that would at least have ample reason to learn to be suspicious at long last of all thinking. Wouldn\\'t thinking have put over on us the biggest hoax yet? And what warrant would there be that it would not continue to do what it has always done? In all seriousness: the innocence of our thinkers is somehow touching and evokes reverence, when today they still step before consciousness with the request that it should please give them honest answers; for example, whether it is \"real,\" and why it so resolutely keeps the external world at a distance, and other questions of that kind. The faith in \"immediate certainties\" is a moral naivet6 that reflects honor on us philosophers; but - after all we should not be \"merely moral\" men. Apart from morality, this faith is a stupidity that reflects little honor on us. In bourgeois life ever-present suspicion may be considered a sign of \"bad character\" and hence belong among things imprudent; here, among us, beyond the bourgeois world and its Yes and No - what should prevent us from being imprudent and saying: a philosopher has nothing less than a right to \"bad character,\" as the being who has so far always been fooled best on earth; he has a duty to suspicion today, to squint maliciously out of every abyss of suspicion. Forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and trope; for I myself have learned long ago to think differently, to estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I keep in reserve at least a couple of jostles for the blind rage with which the philosophers resist being deceived. Why not? It is no more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than mere appearance; it is even the worst proved assumption there is in the world. Let at least this much be admitted: there would be no life at all if not on the basis of perspective estimates and appearances; and if, with the virtuous enthusiasm and clumsiness of some philosophers, one wanted to abolish the \"apparent world\" altogether - well, supposing you could do that, at least nothing would be left of your \"truth\" either. Indeed, what forces us at all to suppose that there is an essential opposition of \"true\" and \"false\"? Is it not sufficient to assume degrees of apparentness and, as it were, lighter and darker shadows and shades of appearance - different \"values,\" to use the language of painters? Why couldn\\'t the world that concerns us be a fiction? And if somebody asked, \"but to a fiction there surely belongs an author?\" - couldn\\'t one answer simply: why? Doesn\\'t this \"belongs\" perhaps belong to the fiction, too? Is it not permitted to be a bit ironical about the subject no less than the predicate and object? Shouldn\\'t philosophers be permitted to rise above faith in grammar? All due respect for governesses - but hasn\\'t the time come for philosophy to renounce the faith of governesses?\\n\\n35\\n\\nO Voltaire! O humaneness! O nonsense! There is something about \"truth,\" about the search for truth; and when a human being is too human about it - \"il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien\" - I bet he finds nothing.\\n\\n36\\n\\nSuppose nothing else were \"given\" as real except our world of desires and passions, and we could not get down, or up, to any other \"reality\" besides the reality of our drives - for thinking is merely a relations of these drives to each other; is it not permitted to make the experiment and to ask the question whether this \"given\" would not be sufficient for also understanding on the basis of this kind of thing the so-called mechanistic (or \"material\") world? 1, mean, not as a deception, as \"mere appearance,\" an \"idea\" (in the sense of Berkeley and Schopenhauer) but as holding the same rank of reality as our affect - as a more primitive form of the world of affects in which everything still lies contained in a powerful unity before it undergoes ramifications and developments in the organic process (and, as is only fair, also becomes tenderer and weaker) - as a kind of instinctive life in which all organic functions are still synthetically intertwined along with self-regulation, assimilation, nourishment, excretion, and metabolism - as a pre-form of life. In the end not only is it permitted to make this experiment; the conscience of method demands it. Not to assume several kinds of causality until the experiment of making do with a single one has been pushed to its utmost limit (to the point of nonsense, if I may say so) - that is a moral of method which one may not shirk today - it follows \"from its definition,\" as a mathematician would say. The question is in the end whether we really recognize the will as efficient, whether we believe in the causality of the will: if we do - and at bottom our faith in this is nothing less than our faith in causality itself - then we have to make the experiment of positing the causality of the will hypothetically as the only one. \"Will,\" of course, can affect only \"will\" - and not \"matter\" (not \"nerves,\" for example). In short, one has to risk the hypothesis whether will does not affect will wherever \"effects\" are recognized - and whether all mechanical occurrences are not, insofar as a force is active in them, will force, effects of will. Suppose, finally, we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one basic form of the will - namely, of the will to power, as my proposition has it; suppose all organic functions could be traced back to this will to power and one could also find in it the solution of the problem of procreation and nourishment - it is one problem - then one would have gained the right to determine all efficient force univocally as - will to power. The world viewed from inside, the world defined and determined according to its \"intelligible character\" - it would be \"will to power\" and nothing else.\\n\\n37\\n\\n\"What? Doesn\\'t this mean, to speak with the vulgar: God is refuted, but the devil is not?\" On the contrary! On the contrary, my friends. And, the devil - who forces you to speak with the vulgar?\\n\\n38\\n\\nWhat happened most recently in the broad daylight of modern times in the case of the French Revolution - that gruesome farce which, considered closely, was quite superfluous, though noble and enthusiastic spectators from all over Europe contemplated it from a distance and interpreted it according to their own indignations and enthusiasms for so long, and so passionately, that the text finally disappeared - under the interpretation - could happen once more as a noble posterity might misunderstand the whole past and in that way alone make it tolerable to look at. Or rather: isn\\'t this what has happened even now? haven\\'t we ourselves been this \"noble posterity\"? And isn\\'t now precisely the moment when, insofar as we comprehend this, it is all over?\\n\\n39\\n\\nNobody is very likely to consider a doctrine true merely because it makes people happy or virtuous - except perhaps the lovely \"idealists\" who become effusive about the good, the true, and the beautiful and allow all kinds of motley, clumsy, and benevolent desiderata to swim around in utter confusion in their pond. Happiness and virtue are no arguments. But people like to forget - even sober spirits - that making unhappy and evil are no counterarguments. Something might be true while being harmful and dangerous in the highest degree. Indeed, it might be a basic characteristic of existence that those who would know it completely would perish, in which case the strength of a spirit should be measured according to how much of the \"truth\" one could still barely endure or to put it more clearly, to what degree one would require it to be thinned down, shrouded, sweetened, blunted, falsified.\"\\' But there is no doubt at all that the evil and unhappy are more favored when it comes to the discovey of certain parts of truth, and that the probability of their success here is greater - not to speak of the evil who are happy, a species the moralists bury in silence. Perhaps hardness and cunning furnish more favorable conditions for the origin of the strong, independent spirit and philosopher than that gentle, fine, conciliatory good-naturedness and art of taking things lightly which people prize, and prize rightly, in a scholar. Assuming first of all that the concept \"philosopher\" is not restricted to the philosopher who writes books - or makes books of his philosophy. A final trait for the image of the free-spirited philosopher is contributed by Stendhal whom, considering German taste, I do not want to fail to stress - for he goes against the German taste. \"Pour etre bon philosopher\" says this last great psychologist, \"il faut etre sec, clair, sans illusion. Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une partie du caractere requis pour faire des dicouvertes en philosophie, c\\'est-ti-dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est.\"\\n\\n40\\n\\nWhatever is profound loves masks; what is most profound even hates image and parable. Might not nothing less than the opposite be the proper disguise for the shame of a god? 2 1 A questionable question: it would be odd if some mystic had not risked something to that effect in his mind. There are occurrences of such a delicate nature that one does well to cover them up with some rudeness to conceal them; there are actions of love and extravagant generosity after which nothing is more advisable than to take a stick and give any eyewitness a sound thrashing: that would muddle his memory. Some know how to muddle and abuse their own memory in order to have their revenge at least against this only witness: shame is inventive. It is not the worst things that cause the worst shame: there is not only guile behind a mask - there is so much graciousness in cunning. I could imagine that a human being who had to guard something precious and vulnerable might roll through life, rude and round as an old green wine cask with heavy hoops: the refinement of his shame would want it that way. A man whose sense of shame has some profundity encounters his destinies and delicate decisions, too, on paths which few ever reach and of whose mere existence his closest intimates must not know: his mortal danger is concealed from their eyes, and so is his regained sureness of life. Such a concealed man who instinctively needs speech for silence and for burial in silence and who is inexhaustible in his evasion of communication, wants and sees to it that a mask of him roams in his place through the hearts and heads of his friends. And supposing he did not want it, he would still realize some day that in spite of that a mask of him is there - and that this is well. Every profound spirit needs a mask: even more, around every profound spirit a mask is growing continually, owing to the constantly false, namely shallow, interpretation of every word, every step, every sign of life he gives.\\n\\n41\\n\\nOne has to test oneself to see that one is destined for independence and command - and do it at the right time. One should not dodge one\\'s tests, though they may be the most dangerous game one could play and are tests that are taken in the end before no witness or judge but ourselves. Not to remain stuck to a person - not even the most loved - every person is a prison, also a nook. Not to remain stuck to a fatherland - not even if it suffers most and needs help most - it is less difficult to sever one\\'s heart from a victorious fatherland. Not to remain stuck to some pity - not even for higher men into whose rare torture and helplessness some accident allowed us to look. Not to remain stuck to a science - even if it should lure us with the most precious finds that seem to have been saved up precisely for us. Not to remain stuck to one\\'s own detachment, to that voluptuous remoteness and strangeness of the bird who flees ever higher to see ever more below him - the danger of the flier. Not to remain stuck to our own virtues and become as a whole the victim of some detail in us, such as our hospitality, which is the danger of dangers for superior and rich souls who spend themselves lavishly, almost indifferently, and exaggerate the virtue of generosity into a vice. One must know how to conserve oneself: the hardest test of independence.\\n\\n42\\n\\nA new species of philosophers is coming up: I venture to baptize them with a name that is not free of danger. As I unriddle them, insofar as they allow themselves to be unriddled - for it belongs to their nature to want to remain riddles at some point these philosophers of the future may have a right - it might also be a wrong - to be called attempters. This name itself is in the end a mere attempt and, if you will, a temptation.\\n\\n43\\n\\nAre these coming philosophers new friends of \"truth\"? That is probable enough, for all philosophers so far have loved their truths. But they will certainly not be dogmatists. It must offend their pride, also their taste, if their truth is supposed to be a truth for every man - which has so far been the secret wish and hidden meaning of all dogmatic aspirations. \"My judgment is my judgment\": no one else is easily entitled to it - that is what such a philosopher of the future may perhaps say of himself. One must shed the bad taste of wanting to agree with many. \"Good\" is no longer good when one\\'s neighbor mouths it. And how should there be a \"common good\"! The term contradicts itself: whatever can be common always has little value. In the end it must be as it is and always has been: great things remain for the great, abysses for the profound, nuances and shudders for the refined, and, in brief, all that is rare for the rare.\\n\\n44\\n\\nNeed I still say expressly after all this that they, too, will be free, very free spirits, these philosophers of the future - though just as certainly they will not be merely free spirits but something more, higher, greater, and thoroughly different that does not want to be misunderstood and mistaken for something else. But saying this I feel an obligation - almost as much to them as to ourselves who are their heralds and precursors, we free spirits - to sweep away a stupid old prejudice and misunderstanding about the lot of us: all too long it has clouded the concept \"free spirit\" like a fog. In all the countries of Europe, and in America, too, there now is something that abuses this name: a very narrow, imprisoned, chained type of spirits who want just about the opposite of what accords with our intentions and instincts - not to speak of the fact that regarding the new philosophers who are coming up they must assuredly be closed windows and bolted doors. They belong, briefly and sadly, among the levelers - these falsely so-called \"free spirits\" - being eloquent and prolifically scribbling slaves of the democratic taste and its \"modern ideas\"; they are all human beings without solitude, without their own solitude, clumsy good fellows whom one should not deny either courage or respectable decency - only they are unfree and ridiculously superficial, above all in their basic inclination to find in the forms of the old society as it has existed so far just about the cause of all human misery and failure - which is a way of standing truth happily upon her head! )What they would like to strive for with all their powers is the universal green-pasture happiness of the herd, with security, lack danger, comfort, and an easier life for everyone; the two songs and doctrines which they repeat most often \"equality of rights\" and , 4 sympathy for all that suffers\" - and suffering itself they take for something that must be abolished. We opposite men, having opened our eyes and conscience to the question where and how the plant \"man\" has so far grown most vigorously to a height - we think that this has happened every time under the opposite conditions, that to this end the dangerousness of his situation must first grow to the point of enormity, his power of invention and simulation (his \"spirit\") had to develop under prolonged pressure and constraint into refinement and audacity, his life - will had to be enhanced into an unconditional power will. We think that hardness, forcefulness, slavery, danger in the alley and the heart, life in hiding, stoicism, the art of experiment and devilry of every kind, that everything evil, terrible, tyrannical in man, everything in him that is kin to beasts of prey and serpents, serves the enhancement of the species \"man\" as much as its opposite does. Indeed, we do not even say enough when we say only that much; and at any rate we are at this point, in what we say and keep silent about, at the other end from all modem ideology and herd desiderata - as their antipodes perhaps? Is it any wonder that we \"free spirits\" are not exactly the most communicative spirits? that we do not want to betray in every particular from what a spirit can liberate himself and to what he may then be driven? And as for the meaning of the dangerous formula \"beyond good and evil,\" with which we at least guard against being mistaken for others: we are something different from \"librespenseurs,\" \"liberi pensatori,\" \"Freidenker\", and whatever else all these goodly advocates of \"modern ideas\" like to call themselves. At home, or at least having been guests, in many countries of the spirit; having escaped again and again from the musty agreeable nooks into which preference and prejudice, youth, origin, the accidents of people and books or even exhaustion from wandering seemed to have banished us; full of malice against the lures of dependence that lie hidden in honors, or money, or offices, or enthusiasms of the senses; grateful even to need and vacillating sickness because they always rid us from some rule and its \"prejudice,\" grateful to god, devil, sheep, and worm in us; curious to a vice, investigators to the point of cruelty, with uninhibited fingers for the unfathomable, with teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible, ready for every feat that requires a sense of acuteness and acute senses, ready for every venture, thanks to an excess of \"free will,\" with fore- and back-souls into whose ultimate intentions nobody can look so easily, with fore- and backgrounds which no foot is likely to explore to the end; concealed under cloaks of light, conquerors even if we look like heirs and prodigals, arrangers and collectors from morning till late, misers of our riches and our crammed drawers, economical in learning and forgetting, inventive in schemas, occasionally proud of tables of categories, occasionally pedants, occasionally night owls of work even in broad daylight; yes, when it is necessary even scarecrows - and today it is necessary; namely, insofar as we are born, sworn, jealous friends of solitude, of our own most profound, most midnightly, most middaily solitude: that is the type of man we are, we free spirits! And perhaps you have something of this, too, you that are coming? you new philosophers?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "'on the prejudices of philosophers the will to truth which will still tempt us to many a venture that famous truthfulness of which all philosophers so far have spoken with respect what questions has this will to truth not laid before us what strange wicked questionable questions that is a long story even now and yet it seems as if it had scarcely begun is it any wonder that we should finally become suspicious lose patience and turn away impatiently that we should finally learn from this sphinx to ask questions too who is it really that puts questions to us here what in us really wants truth indeed we came to a long halt at the question about the cause of this will until we finally came to a complete stop before a still more basic question we asked about the value of this will suppose we want truth why not rather untruth and uncertainty even ignorance the problem of the value of truth came before us or was it we who came before the problem who of us is oedipus here who the sphinx it is a rendezvous it seems of questions and question marks and though it scarcely seems credible it finally almost seems to us as if the problem had never even been put so far as if we were the first to see it fix it with our eyes and risk it for it does involve a risk and perhaps there is none that is greater how could anything originate out of its opposite for example truth out of error or the will to truth out of the will to deception or selfless deeds out of selfishness or the pure and sunlike gaze of the sage out of lust such origins are impossible whoever dreams of them is a fool indeed worse the things of highest value must have another peculiar origin they cannot be derived from this transitory seductive deceptive paltry world from this turmoil of delusion and lust rather from the lap of being the intransitory the hidden god the thing in itself there must be their basis and nowhere else this way of judging constitutes the typical prejudgment and prejudice which give away the metaphysicians of all ages this kind of valuation looms in the background of all their logical procedures it is on account of this faith that they trouble themselves about knowledge about something that is finally baptized solemnly as the truth the fundamental faith of the metaphysicians is the faith in opposite values it has not even occurred to the most cautious among them that one might have a doubt right here at the threshold where it was surely most necessary even if they vowed to themselves de ornnibus dubitandum for one may doubt first whether there are any opposites at all and secondly whether these popular valuations and opposite values on which the metaphysicians put their seal are not perhaps merely foreground estimates only provisional perspectives perhaps even from some nook perhaps from below frog perspective as it were to borrow an expression painters use for all the value that the true the truthful the selfless may deserve it would still be possible that a higher and more fundamental value for life might have to be ascribed to deception selfishness and lust it might even be possible that what constitutes the value of these good and revered things is precisely that they are insidiously related tied to and involved with these wicked seemingly opposite things maybe even one with them in essence maybe but who has the will to concern himself with such dangerous maybes for that one really has to wait for the advent of a new species of philosophers such as have somehow another and converse taste and propensity from those we have known so far philosophers of the dangerous maybe in every sense and in all seriousness i see such new philosophers coming up after having looked long enough between the philosopher s lines and fingers i say to myself by far the greater part of conscious thinking must still be included among instinctive activities and that goes even for philosophical thinking we have to relearn here as one has had to relearn about heredity and what is innate as the act of birth deserves no consideration in the whole process and procedure of heredity so being conscious is not in any decisive sense the opposite of what is instinctive most of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly guided and forced into certain channels by his instincts behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement too there stand valuations or more clearly physiological demands for the preservation of a certain type of life for example that the definite should be worth more than the indefinite and mere appearance worth less than truth such estimates might be in spite of their regulative importance for us nevertheless mere foreground estimates a certain kind of niaiserie which may be necessary for the preservation of just such beings as we are supposing that is that not just man is the measure of things the falseness of a judgment is for us not necessarily an objection to a judgment in this respect our new language may sound strangest the question is to what extent it is life promoting life serving species preserving perhaps even species cultivating and we are fundamentally inclined to claim that the falsest judgments which include the synthetic judgments a priori are the most indispensable for us that without accepting the fictions of logic without measuring reality against the purely invented world of the unconditional and self identical without a constant falsification of the world by means of numbers man could not live that renouncing false judgments would mean renouncing life and a denial of life to recognize untruth as a condition of life that certainly means resisting accustomed value feelings in a dangerous way and a philosophy that risks this would by that token alone place itself beyond good and evil what provokes one to look at all philosophers half suspiciously half mockingly is not that one discovers again and again how innocent they are how often and how easily they make mistakes and go astray in short their childishness and childlikeness but that they are not honest enough in their work although they make a lot of virtuous noise when the problem of truthfulness is touched even remotely they all pose as if they had discovered and reached their real opinions through the self development cold pure divinely unconcerned dialectic as opposed to the mystics of every rank who are more honest and doltish and talk of inspiration while at bottom it is an assumption a hunch indeed a kind of inspiration most often a desire of the heart that has been filtered and made abstract that they defend with reasons they have sought after the fact they are all advocates who resent that name and for the most part even wily spokesmen for their prejudices which they baptize truths and very far from having the courage of the conscience that admits this precisely this to itself very far from having the good taste of the courage which also lets this be known whether to warn an enemy or friend or from exuberance to mock itself the equally stiff and decorous tartuffery of the old kant as he lures us on the dialectical bypaths that lead to his categorical imperative really lead astray and seduce this spectacle makes us smile as we are fastidious and find it quite amusing to watch closely the subtle tricks of old moralists and preachers of morals or consider the hocus pocus of mathematical form with which spinoza a clad his philosophy really the love of his wisdom to render that word fairly and squarely in mail and mask to strike terror at the very outset into the heart of any assailant who should dare to glance at that invincible maiden and pallas athena how much personal timidity and vulnerability this masquerade of a sick hermit betrays gradually it has become clear to me what every great philosophy so far has been namely the personal confession of its author and a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir also that the moral or immoral intentions in every philosophy constituted the real germ of life from which the whole plant had grown indeed if one would explain how the abstrusest metaphysical claims of a philosopher really came about it is always well and wise to ask first at what morality does all this does he aim according i do not believe that a drive to knowledge is the father of philosophy but rather that another drive has here as elsewhere employed understanding and misunderstanding as a mere instrument but anyone who considers the basic drives of man to see to what extent they may have been at play just here as in inspiring spirits or demons and kobolds will find that all of them have done philosophy at some time and that every single one of them would like only too well to represent just itself as the ultimate purpose of existence and the legitimate master of all the other drives for every drive wants to be master and it attempts to philosophize in that spirit to be sure among scholars who are really scientific men things may be different better if you like there you may really find something like a drive for knowledge some small independent clockwork that once well wound works on vigorously without any essential participation from all the other drives of the scholar the real interests of the scholar therefore lie usually somewhere else say in his family or in making money or in politics indeed it is almost a matter of total indifference whether his little machine is placed at this or that spot in science and whether the promising young worker turns himself into a good philologist or an expert on fungi or a chemist it does not characterize him that he becomes this or that in the philosopher conversely there is nothing whatever that is impersonal and above all his morality bears decided and decisive witness to who he is that is in what order of rank the innermost drives of his nature stand in relation to each other how malicious philosophers can be i know of nothing more venomous than the joke epicurus permitted himself against plato and the platonists he called them dionysiokolakes that means literally and this is the foreground meaning flatterers of dionysius in other words tyrant s baggage and lickspittles but addition to this he also wants to say they are all actors there is nothing genuine about them for dionysokolax was a popular name for an actor and the latter is really the malice that epicurus aimed at plato he was peeved by the grandiose manner the mise en scene at which plato and his disciples were so expert at which epicurus was not an expert he that old schoolmaster from samos who sat hidden away in his little garden at athens and wrote three hundred books who knows perhaps from rage and ambition against plato it took a hundred years until greece found out who this garden god epicurus had been did they find out there is a point in every philosophy when the philosopher s conviction appears on the stage or to use the language of an ancient mystery adventavit asinus pulcher et fortissimus according to nature you want to live o you noble stoics what deceptive words these are imagine a being like nature wasteful beyond measure indifferent beyond measure without purposes and consideration without mercy and justice fertile and desolate and uncertain at the same time imagine indifference itself as a power how could you live according to this indifference is that not precisely wanting to be other than this nature is not living estimating preferring being unjust being limited wanting to be different and supposing your imperative live according to nature meant at bottom as much as live according to life how could you not do that why make a principle of what you yourselves are and must be in truth the matter is altogether different while you pretend rapturously to read the canon of your law in nature you want something opposite you strange actors and self deceivers your pride wants to impose your morality your ideal on nature even on nature and incorporate them in her you demand that she be nature according to the stoa and you would like all existence to exist only after your own image as an immense eternal glorification and generalization of stoicism for all your love of truth you have forced yourselves so long so persistently so rigidly hypnotically to see nature the wrong way namely stoically that you are no longer able to see her differently and some abysmal arrogance finally still inspires you with the insane hope that because you know how to tyrannize yourselves stoicism is self tyranny nature too lets herself be tyrannized is not the stoic a piece of nature but this is an ancient eternal story what formerly happened with the stoics still happens today too as soon as any philosophy begins to believe in itself it always creates the world in its own image it cannot do otherwise philosophy is this tyrannical drive itself the most spiritual will to power to the creation of the world to the causa prima the eagerness and subtlety i might even say shrewdness with which the problem of the real and the apparent world is to day attacked all over europe makes one think and wonder and anyone who hears nothing in the background except a will to truth certainly does not have the best of ears in rare and isolate instances it may really be the case that such a will to truth some extravagant and adventurous courage a metaphysician s ambition to hold a hopeless position may participate and ultimately prefer even a handful of certainty to a whole carload of beautiful possibilities there may actually be puritanical fanatics of conscience who prefer even a certain nothing to an uncertain something to lie down on and die but this is nihilism and the sign of a despairing mortally weary soul however courageous the gestures of such a virtue may look it seems however to be otherwise with stronger and livelier thinkers who are still eager for life when they side against appearance and speak of perspective with a new arrogance when they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the credibility of the visual evidence that the earth stands still and thus apparently in good humor let their securest possession go for in what does one at present believe more firmly than in one s body who knows if they are not trying at bottom to win back something that was formerly an even securer possession something of the ancient domain of the faith of former times perhaps the immortal soul perhaps the old god in short ideas by which one could live better that is to say more vigorously and cheerfully than by modern ideas there is mistrust of these modern ideas in this attitude a disbelief in all that has been constructed yesterday and today there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety and scorn unable to endure any longer the bric a brac of concepts of the most diverse origin which is the form in which so called positivism offers itself on the market today a disgust of the more fastidious taste at the village fair motleyness and patchiness of all these reality philosophasters in whom there is nothing new or genuine except this motleyness in this it seems to me we should agree with these skeptical anti realists and knowledge microscopists of today their instinct which repels them from modern reality is unrefuted what do their retrograde bypaths concern us the main thing about them is not that they wish to go back but that they wish to get away a little more strength flight courage and artistic power and they would want to rise not return lt seems to me that today attempts are made everywhere to diver attention from the actual influence kant exerted on german philosophy and especially to ignore prudently the value he set upon himself kant was first and foremost proud of his table of categories with that in his hand he said this is the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics let us only understand this could be he was proud of having discovered a new faculty in man the faculty for synthetic judgments a priori suppose he deceived himself in this matter the development and rapid flourishing of german philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride and on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible something still prouder at all events new faculties but let us reflect it is high time to do so how are synthetic judgments a priori possible kant asked himself and what really is his answer by virtue of a faculty but unfortunately not in five words but so circumstantially venerably and with such a display of german profundity and curlicues that people simply failed to note the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer people were actually beside themselves with delight over this new faculty and the jubilation reached its climax when kant further discovered a moral faculty in man for at that time the germans were still moral and not yet addicted to realpolitik the honeymoon of german philosophy arrived all the young theologians of the tubingen seminary went into the bushes all looking for faculties and what did they not find in that innocent rich and still youthful period of the german spirit to which romanticism the malignant fairy piped and sang when one could not yet distinguish between finding and inventing above all a faculty for the surprasensible schelling christened it intellectual intuition and thus gratified the most heartfelt cravings of the germans whose cravings were at bottom pious one can do no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and enthushiastic movement which was really youthfulness however boldly it disguised itself in hoary and senile concepts than to take it seriously or worse to treat it with moral indignation enough one grew older and the dream vanished a time came when people scratched their heads and they still scratch them today one had been dreaming and first and foremost old kant by virtue of a faculty he had said or at least meant but is that an answer an explanation or is it not rather merely a repetition of the question how does opium induce sleep by virtue of a faculty namely the virtus dormitiva replies the doctor in moliere quia est in eo virtus dormitiva cujus est natura sensus assoupire but such replies belong in comedy and it is high time to replace the kantian question how are synthetic judgments a priori possible by another question why is belief in such judgments necassary and to comprehend that such judgments must be believed to be true for the sake of the preservation of creatures like ourselves though they might of course be false judgments for all that or to speak more clearly and coarsely synthetic judgments a priori should not be possible at all we have no right to them in our mouths they are nothing but false judgments only of course the belief in their truth is necessary as a foreground belief and visual evidence belonging to the perspective optics of life finally to call to mind the enormous influence that german philosophy i hope you understand its right to quotation marks has exercised throughout the whole of europe there is no doubt that a certain virtus dormitiva had a share in it it was a delight to the noble idlers the virtuous the mystics artists three quarter christians and political obscurantists of all nations to find thanks to german philosophy an antidote to the still predominant sensualism which overflowed from the last century into this in short sensus assoupire as for materialistic atomism it is one of the best refuted theories there are and in europe perhaps no one in the learned world is now so unscholarly as to attach serious significance to it for convenient household use as an abbreviation of the means of expression thanks chiefly to the dalmatian boscovich and the pole corpernicus have been the greatest and most successful opponents of visual evidence so far for while copernicus has persuaded us to believe contrary to all the senses that the earth does not stand fast boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the last part of the earth that stood fast the belief in substance in matter in the earth residuum and particle atom it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has been gained on earth so far one must however go still further and also declare war relentless war unto death against the atomistic need which still leads a dangerous afterlife in places where no one suspects it just like the more celebrated metaphysical need one must also first of all give the finishing stroke to that other and more calamitous atomism which christianity has taught best and longest the soul atomism let it be permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the soul as something indestructible eternal in divisible as a monad as an atomon this belief ought to be expelled from science between ourselves it is not at all necessary to get rid of the soul at the same time and thus to renounce one of the most ancient and venerable hypotheses as happens frequently to clumsy naturalists who can hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it but the way is open for new versions and refinements of the soul hypothesis and such conceptions as mortal soul and soul as subjective multiplicity and soul as social structure of the drives and affects want henceforth to have citizens rights in science when the new psychologist puts an end to the superstitions which have so far flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of the soul he practically exiles himself into a new desert and a new suspicion it is possible that the older psychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of it eventually however he finds that precisely thereby he also concerns himself to invention and who knows perhaps to discovery physiologists should think before putting down the instinct of self preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being a living thing seeks above all to discharge its strength life itself is will to power self preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent results in short here as everywhere else let us beware of superfluous teleological principles one of which is the instinct of self preservation we owe it to spinoza s inconsistency thus method which must be essentially economy of principles demands it it is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that physics too is only an interpretation and exegesis of the world to suit us if i may say so and not a world explanation but insofar as it is based on belief in the senses it is regarded as more and for a long time to come must be regarded as more namely as an explanation eyes and fingers speak in its favor visual evidence and palpableness do too this strikes an age with fundamentally plebian tastes as fascinating persuasive and convincing after all it follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternally popular sensualism what is clear what is explained only what can be seen and felt every problem has to be pursued to that point conversely the charm of the platonic way of thinking which was a noble way of thinking consisted precisely in resistance to obvious sense evidence perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more demanding senses than our contemporaries but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of their senses and this by means of pale cold gray concept nets which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses the mob of the senses as plato said in this overcoming of the world and interpreting of the world in the manner of plato there was an enjoyment different from that which the physicists of today offer us and also the darwinists and anti teleologists among the workers in physiology with their principle of the smallest possible force and the greatest possible stupidity where man cannot find anything to see or to grasp he has no further business that is certainly an imperative different from the platonic one but it may be the right imperative for a tough industrious race of machinists and bridge builders of the future who have nothing but rough work to do to study physiology with a clear conscience one must insist that the sense organs are not phenomena in the sense of idealistic philosophy as such they could not be causes sensualism therefore at least as a regulative hypothesis if not as a heuristic principle what and others even say that the external world is the work of our organs but then our body as a part of this external world would be the work of our organs but then our organs themselves would be the work of our organs it seems to me that this is a complete reductio ad absurdum assuming that the concept of a causa sui is something fundamentally absurd consequently the external world is just the work of our organs there are still harmless self observers who believe that there are immediate certainties for example i think or as the superstition of schopenhauer put it i will as though knowledge here got hold of its object purely and nakedly as the thing in it self without any falsification on the part of either the subject or the object but that immediate certainty as well as absolute knowledge and the thing in itself involve a contradictio adjecto i shall repeat a hundred times we really ought to free our selves from the seduction of words let the people suppose that knowledge means knowing things entirely the philosopher must say to himself when i analyze the process that is expressed in the sentence i think i find a whole series of daring assertions that would be difficult perhaps impossible to prove for example that it is i who think that there must neccssarily be something that thinks that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause that there is an ego and finally that it is already determined what is to be designated by thinking that i know what thinking is for if i had not already decided within myself what it is by what standard could i determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps willing or feeling in short the assertion i think assumes that i compare my state at the present moment with other states of myself which i know in order to determine what it is on account of this retrospective connection with further knowledge it has at any rate no immediate certainty for me in place of the immediate certainty in which the people may believe in the case at hand the philosopher thus finds a series of metaphysical questions presented to him truly searching questions of the intellect to wit from where do i get the concept of thing why do i believe in cause and effect what gives me the right to speak of an ego and even of an ego as cause and finally ego as the cause of thought whoever ventures to answer the metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a sort of intuitive perception like the person who says i think and know that at least is true actual and certain will encounter a smile and two question marks from a philosopher nowadays sir the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand it is improbable that you are not mistaken but why insist on the truth with regard to the superstitions of logicians i shall never tire of emphasizing a small terse fact which these superstitious minds hate to concede namely that a thought comes when it wishes and not when i wish so that it is a falsification of the facts of the case to say that the subject i is the condition of the predicate think it thinks but that this it is precisely the famous old ego is to put it mildly only a supposition an assertion and assuredly not an immediate certainty after all one has even gone too far with this it thinks even the it contains an interpretation of the process and does not belong to the process itself ne infers here according to the grammatical habit thinking is an activity every activity requires an agent consequently it was pretty much according to the same schema that the older atomism sought besides the operating power that lump of matter in which it resides and out of which it operates the atom more rigorous minds however learned at last to get along without this earth residuum and perhaps some day we shall accustom ourselves including the logicians to get along without the little it which is all that is left of the honest little old ego it is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable it is precisely thereby that it attracts subtler minds it seems that the hundred times refuted theory of a free will owes its persistence to this charm alone again and again someone comes along who feels he is strong enough to refute it philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as if it were the best known thing in the world indeed schopenhauer has given us to understand that the will alone is really known to us absolutely and completely known without subtraction or addition but again and again it seems to me that in this case too schopenhauer only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing he adopted a popular prejudice and exaggerated it willing seems to me to be above all something complicated something that is a unit only as a word and it is precisely in this one word that the popular prejudice lurks which has defeated the always inadequate caution of philosophers so let us for once be more cautious let us be unphilosophical let us say that in all willing there is first a plurality of sensations namely the sensation of the state away from which the sensation of the state towards which the sensation of this from and towards themselves and then also an accompanying muscular sensation which even without our putting into motion arms and legs begins its action by force of habit as soon as we will anything therefore just as sensations and indeed many kinds of sensation are to be recognized as ingredients of the will so secondly should thinking also in every act of the will there is a ruling thought let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from the willing as if any will would then remain over third the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking but it is above all an affect and specifically the affect of the command that which is termed freedom of the will is essentially the affect of superiority in relation to him who must obey i am free he must obey this consciousness is inherent in every will and equally so the straining of the attention the straight look that fixes itself exclusively on one aim the unconditional evaluation that thls and nothing else is necessary now the inward certainty that obedience will be rendered and whatever else belongs to the position of the commander a man who wills commands something within himself that renders obedience or that he believes renders obedience but now let us notice what is strangest about the will this manifold thing for which the people have only one word inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding and the obeying parties and as the obeying party we know the sensations of constraint impulsion pressure resistance and motion which usually begin immediately after the act of will inasmuch as on the other hand we are accustomed to disregard this duality and to deceive ourselves about it by means of thc synthetic concept i a whole series of erroneous conclusions and consequently of false evaluations of the will itself has become attached to the act of willing to such a degree that he who wills believes sincerely that willing suffices for action since in thc great majority of cases there has been exereise of will only when the effect of the command that is obedience that is the action was to be expected the appearance has translated itself into the feeling as if there were a necessity of effect in short he who wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow one he ascribes the success the carrying out of the willing to the will itself and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success freedom of the will that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order who as such enjoys also the triumph over obstacles but thinks within himself that it was really his will itself that overcame them in this way the person exercising volition adds the feeling of delight of his successful executive instruments the useful under wills or under souls indeed our body is but a social structure composed of many souls to his feelings of delight as commander l effet c est moi what happens here is what happens in every well constructed and happy commonwealth namely the governing class identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth in all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying on the basis as already said of a social structure composed of many souls hence a philosopher should claim the right to include willomg as such within the sphere of morals morals being understood as the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phemenon of life comes to be that individual philosophical concepts are not anything capricious or autonomously evolving but grow up in connection and reltionship with each other that however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought they nevertheless belong just as much to a system as all the members of the fauna of a continent is betrayed in the end also by the fact that the most diverse philosophers keep filling in a definite fundamental scheme of possible philosophies under an invisible spell they always revolve once more in the same orbit however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills something within them leads them something impels them in a definite order one after the other to wit the innate systematic structure and relationship of their concepts their thinking is in fact far less a discovery than a recognition a remembering a return and a homecoming to a remote primordial an inclusive houschold of the soul out of which those concepts grew originall philosophizing is to this extent a kind of atavism of the highest order the strange family resemblance of all lndian greck and german philosophizing is explained easily enough where there is affinity of languages it cannot fail owing to the common philosophy of grammar i mean owing to the unconscious domination and guidance by similar grammatical functions that everything is prepared at the outset for a similar development and sequence of philosophical systems just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of world interpretation it is highly probable that philosophers wlthin the domain of the ural altaic languages where the concept of the subject is least developed look otherwise into the world and will be found on paths of thought different from those of the indo germanic peoples and the muslims the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately also the spell of physiological valuations and racial conditions so much by way of rejecting locke s superficiality regardinh the origin of ideas the causa sui is the best self contradiction that has been conceived so far it is a sort of rape and perversion of logic but the extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with just this nonsense the desire for free dom of the will in the superlative metaphysical sense which still holds sway unfortunately in the minds of the half educated the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one s actions oneself and to absolve god the world ancestors chance and society involves nothing less than to be precisely this causa sui and with more than munchhausen s audacity to pull oneself up into existence by the hair out of the swamps of nothingness suppose someone were thus to see through the boorish simplicity of this celebrated concept of free will and put it out of his head altogether l beg of him to carry his enlightenment a step further and so put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception of free will i mean unfree will which amounts to a misuse of cause and effect one should not wrongly reify cause and effect as the natural scientists do and whoever like them now naturalizes in his thinking according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it effects its end one should use cause and effect only as pure concepts that is to say as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and communication not for explanation in the in itself there is nothing of causal connections of necessity or of psychological non freedom there the effect does not follow the cause there is no rule of law it is we alone who have devised cause sequence for each other relativity constraint number law freedom motive and purpose and when we project and mix this symbol world into things as if it existed in itself we act once more as we have always acted mythologically the unfree will is mythology in real life it is only a matter of strong and weak wills lt is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker senses in every causal connection and psychological necessity something of constraint need compulsion to obey pressure and unfreedom it is suspicious to have such feelings that person betrays himself and in general if i have observed correctly the unfreedom of the will is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints but always in a profoundly personal manner some will not give up their responsibility their belief in themselves the personal right to their merits at any price the vain races belong to this class others on the contrary do not wish to be answerable for anything or blamed for anything and owing to an inward self contempt seek to lay the blame for them selves somewhere else the latter when they write books are in the habit today of taking the side of criminals a sort of socialist pity is thelr most attractive disguise and as a matter of fact the fatalism of the weak willed embellishes itself surprisingly when it can pose as la religion de la souffrance humaine that is its good taste forgive me as an old philologist who cannot desist from the malice of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation but nature s conformity to law of which you physicists talk so proudly as though why it exists only owing to your interpretion and bad philology it is no matter of fact no text but rather only a naively humanitarian emendation and perversion of meaning with which you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern soul everywhere equality bcfore the law nature is no different in that respect no better off than we are a fine instance of ulterior motivation in which the plebian antagonism to everything privileged and autocratic as well as a second and more refined atheism are disguised once more ni dieu ni maltre that is what you too want and therefore cheers for the law of nature is it not so but as said above that is interpretation not text and somebody might come along who with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation could read out of the same nature and with regard to the same phenomena rather the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of claims of power an interpreter who would picture the unexceptional and unconditional aspects of all will to power so vividly that almost every word even the word tyranny itself would eventually sound unsuitable or a weakening and attenuating metaphor being too human but he might nevertheless end by asserting the same about this world as you do namely that it has a necessary and calculable course not because laws obtain in it but because they are absolutely lacking and every power draws its ultimate consequences at every moment supposing that this also is only interpreation and you will be eager enough to make this objection well sp much the better all psychology so far has got stuck in moral prejudices and fears it has not dared to descend into the depths to understand it as morphology and the doctrine of the development of the will to power as i do nobody has yet come close to doing this even in thought insofar as it is permissible to recognize in what has been written so far a symptom of what has so far been kept silent the power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most spiritual world which would seem to be the coldest and most devoid of presuppositions and has obviously operated in an injurious inhibiting blinding and distorting manner a proper physio psychology has to contend with unconscious resistance in the heart of the investigator it has the heart against it even a doctrine of thc reciprocal dependence of the good and the wicked drives causes as refined immorality distress and aversion in a still hale and hearty conscience still more so a doctrine of the derivation of good impulses from wicked ones if however a person should regard even the affects of hatred envy covetousness and the lust to rule as conditions of life as factors which fundamcntally and essentially must be present in the general cconomy of life and must there be further enhanced if life is to be further enhanced he will suffer from such a view of things as from seasickness and yet even this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous insights and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why everyone should keep away from it who can on the other hand if one has once drifted there with one s bark well all right let us clench our teeth let us open our eyes and keep our hand firm on the helm we sail right over morality we crush we destroy perhaps the remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage there but what matter are we never yet did a profounder world of insight reveal itself to daring travelers and adventurers and the psychologist who thus makes a sacrifice it is not the sacrifizio dell intelletto on the contrary will at least be entitled to demand in return that psychology shall be recognized again as the queen of the sciences for whose service and preparation the other sciences exist for psychology is now again the path to the fundamental problems the free spirit o sancta simplicitas in what strange simplification and falsification man lives one can never cease wondering once one has acquired eyes for this marvel how we have made everything around us clear and free and easy and simple how we have been able to give our senses a passport to everything superficial our thoughts a divine desire for wanton leaps and wrong inferences how from the beginning we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost inconceivable freedom lack of scruple and caution heartiness and gaiety of life in order to enjoy life and only on this now solid granite foundation of ignorance could knowledge rise so far the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful will the will to ignorance to the uncertain to the untrue not as its opposite but as its refinement even if language here as elsewhere will not get over its awkwardness and will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees and many subtleties of gradation even if the inveterate tartuffery of morals which now belongs to our unconquerable flesh and blood infects the words even of those of us who know better here and there we understand it and laugh at the way in which precisely science at its best seeks most to keep us in this simplified thoroughly artificial suitably constructed and suitably falsified world at the way in which willy nilly it loves error because being alive it loves life after such a cheerful commencement a serious word would like to be heard it appeals to the most serious take care philosophers and friends of knowledge and beware of martyrdom of suffering for the truth s sake even of defending yourselves spoils all the innocence and fine neutrality of your conscience makes you headstrong against objections and red rags it stupefies animalizes and brutalizes when in the struggle with danger slander suspicion expulsion and even worse consequences of hostility you have to pose as protectors of truth upon earth as though the truth were such an innocuous and incompetent creature as to require protectors and you of all people you knights of the most sorrowful countenances dear loafers and cobweb spinners of the spirit after all you know well enough that it cannot be of any con sequence if you of all people are proved right you know that no philosopher so far has been proved right and that there might be a more laudable truthfulness in every little question mark that you place after your special words and favorite doctrines and occasionally after yourselves than in all the solemn gestures and trumps before accusers and law courts rather go away flee into concealment and have your masks and subtlety that you ma mistaken for what you are not or feared a little and don t the garden the garden with golden trelliswork and have around you who are as a garden or as music on the waters evening when the day is turning into memories choose the solitude the free playful light solitude that gives you too the right to remain good in some sense how poisonous how crafty hot bad does every long war make one that cannot be waged open by means of force how personal does a long fear make one long watching of enemies of possible enemies these outcasts society these long pursued wickedly persecuted ones also compulsory recluses the spinozas or giordano brunos always come in the end even under the most spiritual masquerade perhaps without being themselves aware of it sophisticated vengeance seekers and poison brewers let someone lay bare the foundation of spinoza s ethics and theology not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that his philosophical sense of humor has left him the martyrdom of the philosopher his sacrifice for the sake of truth forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him and if one has so far contemplated him only with artistic curiosity with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous desire to see him also in his degeneration degenerated into a martyr into a stage and platform bawler only that it is necessary with such a desire to be clear what spectacle one will see in any case merely a satyr play merely an epilogue farce merely the continued proof that the long real tragedy is at an end assuming that every philosophy was in its genesis a long tragedy every choice human being strives instinctively for a citadel and a secrecy where he is saved from the crowd the many the great majority where he may forget men who are the rule being their exception excepting only the one case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct as a seeker after knowledge in the great and exceptional sense anyone who in intercourse with men does not occasionally glisten in all the colors of distress green and gray with disgust satiety sympathy gloominess and loneliness is certainly not a man of elevated tastes supposing however that he does not take all this burden and disgust upon himself voluntarily that he persistently avoids it and remains as i said quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel one thing is certain he was not made he was not predestined for knowledge if he were he would one day have to say to himself the devil take my good taste but the rule is more interesting than the exception than myself the exception and be would go down and above all he would go inside the long and serious study of the average man and consequently much disguise self overcoming familiarity and bad contact all contact is bad contact except with one s equals this constitutes a necessary part of the life history of every philosopher perhaps the most disagreeable odious and disappointing part if he is fortunate however as a favorite child of knowledge should be he will encounter suitable shortcuts and helps for his task i mean so called cynics those who simply recognize the animal the commonplace and the rule in themselves and at the same time still have that degree of spirituality and that itch which makes them talk of themselves and their likes before witnesses sometimes they even wallow in books as on their own dung cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach honesty and the higher man must listen closely to every coarse or subtle cynicism and congratulate himself when a clown without shame or a scientific satyr speaks out precisely in front of him there are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgust namely where by a freak of nature genius is tied to some such indiscreet billygoat and ape as in the case of the abbe galiani the profoundest most clear sighted and perhaps also filthiest man of his century he was far profounder than voltaire and consequently also a good deal more taciturn it happens more frequently as has been hinted that a scientific head is placed on an ape s body a subtle exceptional understanding in a base soul an occurrence by no means rare especially among doctors and physiologists of morality and whenever anyone speaks without bitterness quite innocently of man as a belly with two requirements and a head with one whenever anyone sees seeks and wants to see only hunger sexual lust and vanity as the real and only motives of human actions in short when anyone speaks badly and not even wickedly of man the lover of knowledge should listen subtly land diligently he should altogether have an open ear wherever people talk without indignation for the indignant and whoever perpetually tears and lacerates with his own teeth himself or as a substitute the world or god or society may indeed morally speaking stand higher than the laughing and self satisfied satyr but in every other sense they are a more ordinary more indifferent and less instructive case and no one lies as much as the indignant do it is hard to be understood especially when one thinks and lives gangasrotagati among men who think and live differently namely kurmagati or at best the way frogs walk mandukagati i obviously do everything to be hard to understan myself and one should be cordially grateful for the good will to some subtlety of interpretation as regards the good friends however who are always too lazy and think that as friends they have a right to relax one does well to grant them from the outset some leeway and romping place for misunderstanding then on can even laugh or get rid of them altogether these good friends and also laugh what is most difficult to render from one language into an other is the tempo of its style which has its basis in the character of the race or to speak more physiologically in the average temp of its metabolism there are honestly meant translations that a involuntary vulgarizations are almost falsifications of the original merely because its bold and merry tempo which leaps over an obviates all dangers in things and words could not be translates a german is almost incapable of presto in his language thus also as may be reasonably inferred of many of the most delightful and daring nuances of free free spirited thought and just as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience so aristophanes and petronius are untranslatable for him everything ponderous viscous and solemnly clumsy all long winded and boring types of style are developed in profuse variety among german forgive me the fact that even goethe s prose in its mixture o stiffness and elegance is no exception being a reflection of the good old time to which it belongs and a reflection of german taste at a time when there still was a german taste a rococo taste in moribus et artibus lessing is an exception owing to his histrionic nature which understood much and understood how to do many things he was not the translator of bayle for nothing and liked to flee to the neighborhood of diderot and voltaire and better yet that of the roman comedy writers in tempo too lessing loved free thinking and escape from germany but how could the german language even in the prose of a lessing imitate the tempo of machiavelli who in his principe the prince lets us breathe the dry refined air of florence and cannot help presenting the most serious matters in a boisterous allegrissimo perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he risks long difficult hard dangerous thoughts and the tempo of the gallop and the very best most capricious humor who finally could venture on a german translation of petronius who more than any great musician so far was a master of presto in invention ideas and words what do the swamps of the sick wicked world even the ancient world matter in the end when one has the feet of a wind as he did the rush the breath the liberating scorn of a wind that makes everything healthy by making everything run and as for aristopbanes that transfiguring complementary spirit for whose sake one forgives everything hellenic for having existed provided one has understood in its full profundity all that needs to be forgiven and transfigured here there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on platiys secrecy and sphinx nature than the happily preserved petit fait that under the pillow of his deathbed there was found no bible nor anything egyptian pythagorean or platonic but a volume of aristophanes how could even plato have endured life a greek life he repudiated without an aristophanes independence is for the very few it is a privilege of the strong and whoever attempts it even with the best right but without inner constraint proves that he is probably not only strong but also daring to the point of recklessness he enters into a labyrinth he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life brings with it in any case not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way becomes lonely and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience supposing one like that comes to grief this happens so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it nor sympathize and he cannot go back any longer nor can he go back to the pity of men our highest insights must and should sound like follies and sometimes like crimes when they are heard without permission by those who are not predisposed and predestined for them the difference between the exoteric and the esoteric formerly known to philosophers among the indians as among the greeks persians and muslims in short wherever one believed in an order of rank and not in equality and equal rights does not so much consist in this that the exoteric approach comes from outside and sees estimates measures and judges from the outside not the inside what is much more essential is that the exoteric approach sees things from below the esoteric looks down from above there are heights of the soul from which even tragedy ceases to look tragic and rolling together all the woe of the world who could dare to decide whether its sight would necessarily seduce us and compel us to feel pity and thus double this woe what serves the higher type of men as nourishment or delectation must almost be poison for a very different and inferior type the virtues of the common man might perhaps signify vices and weaknesses in a philosopher it could be possible that a man of a high type when degenerating and perishing might only at that point acquire qualities that would require those in the lower sphere into which he had sunk to begin to venerate him like a saint there are books that have opposite values for soul and health depending on whether the lower soul the lower vitality or the higher and more vigorous ones turn to them in the former case these books are dangerous and lead to crumbling and disintegration in the latter heralds cries that call the bravest to their courage books for all the world are always foul smelling books the smell of small people clings to them where the people eat and drink even where they venerate it usually stinks one should not go to church if one wants to breathe pure air when one is young one venerates and despises without that art of nuances which constitutes the best gain of life and it is only fair that one has to pay dearly for having assaulted men and things in this manner with yes and no everything is arranged so that the worst of tastes the taste for the unconditional should be cruelly fooled and abused until a man learns to put a little art into his feelings and rather to risk trying even what is artificial as the real artists of life do the wrathful and reverent attitudes characteristic of youth do not seem to permit themselves any rest until they have forged men and things in such a way that these attitudes may be vented on them after all youth in itself has something of forgery and deception later when the young soul tortured by all kinds of disappointments finally turns suspiciously against itself still hot and wild even in its suspicion and pangs of conscience how wroth it is with itself now how it tears itself to pieces impatiently how it takes revenge for its long self delusion just as if it had been a deliberate blindness in this transition one punishes oneself with mistrust against one s own feelings one tortures one s own enthusiasm with doubts indeed one experiences even a good conscience as a danger as if it were a way of wrapping oneself in veils and the exhaustion of subtler honesty and above all one takes sides takes sides on principle against youth ten years later one comprehends that all this too was still youth during the longest part of human history so called prehistorical times the value or disvalue of an action was derived from its consequences the action itself was considered as little as its origin it was rather the way a distinction or disgrace still reaches back today from a child to its parents in china it was the retroactive force of success or failure that led men to think well or ill of an action let us call this period the pre moral period of mankind the imperative know thyself was as yet unknown in the last ten thousand years however one has reached the point step by step in a few large regions on the earth where it is no longer the consequences but the origin of an action that one allows to decide its value on the whole this is a great event which involves a considerable refinement of vision and standards it is the unconscious aftereffect of the rule of aristocratic values and the faith in descent the sign of a period that one may call moral in the narrower sense it involves the first attempt at self knowledge instead of the consequences the origin indeed a reversal of perspective surely a reversal achieved only after long struggles and vacillations to be sure a calamitous new superstition an odd narrowness of interpretation thus become dominant the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite sense as origin in an intention one came to agree that the value of an action lay in the value of the intention the intention as the whole origin and prehistory of an action almost to the present day this prejudice dominated moral praise blame judgment and philosophy on earth but today shouldn t we have reached the necessity of once more resolving on a reversal and fundamental shift in values owing to another self examination of man another growth in profundity don t we stand at the threshold of a period which should be designated negatively to begin with as extra moral after all today at least we immoralists have the suspicion that the decisive value of an action lies precisely in what is unintentional in it while everything about it that is intentional everything about it that can be seen known conscious still belongs to its surface and skin which like every skin betrays something but conceals even more in short we believe that the intention is merely a sign and symptom that still requires interpretation moreover a sign that means too much and therefore taken by itself alone almost nothing we believe that morality in the traditional sense the morality of intentions was a prejudice precipitate and perhaps provisional something on the order of astrology and alchemy but in any case something that must be overcome the overcoming of morality in a certain sense even the self overcoming of morality let this be the name for that long secret work which has been saved up for the finest and most honest also the most malicious consciences of today as living touchstones of the soul there is no other way the feelings of devotion self sacrifice for one s neighbor the whole morality of self denial must be questioned mercilessly and taken to court no less than the aesthetics of contemplation devoid of all interest which is used today as a seductive guise for the emasculation of art to give it a good conscience there is too much charm and sugar in these feelings of for others not for myself for us not to need to become doubly suspicious at this point and to ask are these not perhaps seductions that they please those who have them and those who enjoy their fruits and also the mere spectator this does not yet constitute an argument in their favor but rather invites caution so let us be cautious whatever philosophical standpoint one may adopt today from every point of view the erroneousness of the world in which we think we live is the surest and firmest fact that we can lay eyes on we find reasons upon reasons for it which would like to lure us to hypotheses concerning a deceptive principle in the essence of things but whoever holds our thinking itself the spirit in other words responsible for the falseness of the world an honorable way out which is chosen by every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei whoever takes this world along with space time form movement to be falsely inferred anyone like that would at least have ample reason to learn to be suspicious at long last of all thinking wouldn t thinking have put over on us the biggest hoax yet and what warrant would there be that it would not continue to do what it has always done in all seriousness the innocence of our thinkers is somehow touching and evokes reverence when today they still step before consciousness with the request that it should please give them honest answers for example whether it is real and why it so resolutely keeps the external world at a distance and other questions of that kind the faith in immediate certainties is a moral naivet that reflects honor on us philosophers but after all we should not be merely moral men apart from morality this faith is a stupidity that reflects little honor on us in bourgeois life ever present suspicion may be considered a sign of bad character and hence belong among things imprudent here among us beyond the bourgeois world and its yes and no what should prevent us from being imprudent and saying a philosopher has nothing less than a right to bad character as the being who has so far always been fooled best on earth he has a duty to suspicion today to squint maliciously out of every abyss of suspicion forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and trope for i myself have learned long ago to think differently to estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived and i keep in reserve at least a couple of jostles for the blind rage with which the philosophers resist being deceived why not it is no more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than mere appearance it is even the worst proved assumption there is in the world let at least this much be admitted there would be no life at all if not on the basis of perspective estimates and appearances and if with the virtuous enthusiasm and clumsiness of some philosophers one wanted to abolish the apparent world altogether well supposing you could do that at least nothing would be left of your truth either indeed what forces us at all to suppose that there is an essential opposition of true and false is it not sufficient to assume degrees of apparentness and as it were lighter and darker shadows and shades of appearance different values to use the language of painters why couldn t the world that concerns us be a fiction and if somebody asked but to a fiction there surely belongs an author couldn t one answer simply why doesn t this belongs perhaps belong to the fiction too is it not permitted to be a bit ironical about the subject no less than the predicate and object shouldn t philosophers be permitted to rise above faith in grammar all due respect for governesses but hasn t the time come for philosophy to renounce the faith of governesses o voltaire o humaneness o nonsense there is something about truth about the search for truth and when a human being is too human about it il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien i bet he finds nothing suppose nothing else were given as real except our world of desires and passions and we could not get down or up to any other reality besides the reality of our drives for thinking is merely a relations of these drives to each other is it not permitted to make the experiment and to ask the question whether this given would not be sufficient for also understanding on the basis of this kind of thing the so called mechanistic or material world mean not as a deception as mere appearance an idea in the sense of berkeley and schopenhauer but as holding the same rank of reality as our affect as a more primitive form of the world of affects in which everything still lies contained in a powerful unity before it undergoes ramifications and developments in the organic process and as is only fair also becomes tenderer and weaker as a kind of instinctive life in which all organic functions are still synthetically intertwined along with self regulation assimilation nourishment excretion and metabolism as a pre form of life in the end not only is it permitted to make this experiment the conscience of method demands it not to assume several kinds of causality until the experiment of making do with a single one has been pushed to its utmost limit to the point of nonsense if i may say so that is a moral of method which one may not shirk today it follows from its definition as a mathematician would say the question is in the end whether we really recognize the will as efficient whether we believe in the causality of the will if we do and at bottom our faith in this is nothing less than our faith in causality itself then we have to make the experiment of positing the causality of the will hypothetically as the only one will of course can affect only will and not matter not nerves for example in short one has to risk the hypothesis whether will does not affect will wherever effects are recognized and whether all mechanical occurrences are not insofar as a force is active in them will force effects of will suppose finally we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one basic form of the will namely of the will to power as my proposition has it suppose all organic functions could be traced back to this will to power and one could also find in it the solution of the problem of procreation and nourishment it is one problem then one would have gained the right to determine all efficient force univocally as will to power the world viewed from inside the world defined and determined according to its intelligible character it would be will to power and nothing else what doesn t this mean to speak with the vulgar god is refuted but the devil is not on the contrary on the contrary my friends and the devil who forces you to speak with the vulgar what happened most recently in the broad daylight of modern times in the case of the french revolution that gruesome farce which considered closely was quite superfluous though noble and enthusiastic spectators from all over europe contemplated it from a distance and interpreted it according to their own indignations and enthusiasms for so long and so passionately that the text finally disappeared under the interpretation could happen once more as a noble posterity might misunderstand the whole past and in that way alone make it tolerable to look at or rather isn t this what has happened even now haven t we ourselves been this noble posterity and isn t now precisely the moment when insofar as we comprehend this it is all over nobody is very likely to consider a doctrine true merely because it makes people happy or virtuous except perhaps the lovely idealists who become effusive about the good the true and the beautiful and allow all kinds of motley clumsy and benevolent desiderata to swim around in utter confusion in their pond happiness and virtue are no arguments but people like to forget even sober spirits that making unhappy and evil are no counterarguments something might be true while being harmful and dangerous in the highest degree indeed it might be a basic characteristic of existence that those who would know it completely would perish in which case the strength of a spirit should be measured according to how much of the truth one could still barely endure or to put it more clearly to what degree one would require it to be thinned down shrouded sweetened blunted falsified but there is no doubt at all that the evil and unhappy are more favored when it comes to the discovey of certain parts of truth and that the probability of their success here is greater not to speak of the evil who are happy a species the moralists bury in silence perhaps hardness and cunning furnish more favorable conditions for the origin of the strong independent spirit and philosopher than that gentle fine conciliatory good naturedness and art of taking things lightly which people prize and prize rightly in a scholar assuming first of all that the concept philosopher is not restricted to the philosopher who writes books or makes books of his philosophy a final trait for the image of the free spirited philosopher is contributed by stendhal whom considering german taste i do not want to fail to stress for he goes against the german taste pour etre bon philosopher says this last great psychologist il faut etre sec clair sans illusion un banquier qui a fait fortune a une partie du caractere requis pour faire des dicouvertes en philosophie c est ti dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est whatever is profound loves masks what is most profound even hates image and parable might not nothing less than the opposite be the proper disguise for the shame of a god a questionable question it would be odd if some mystic had not risked something to that effect in his mind there are occurrences of such a delicate nature that one does well to cover them up with some rudeness to conceal them there are actions of love and extravagant generosity after which nothing is more advisable than to take a stick and give any eyewitness a sound thrashing that would muddle his memory some know how to muddle and abuse their own memory in order to have their revenge at least against this only witness shame is inventive it is not the worst things that cause the worst shame there is not only guile behind a mask there is so much graciousness in cunning i could imagine that a human being who had to guard something precious and vulnerable might roll through life rude and round as an old green wine cask with heavy hoops the refinement of his shame would want it that way a man whose sense of shame has some profundity encounters his destinies and delicate decisions too on paths which few ever reach and of whose mere existence his closest intimates must not know his mortal danger is concealed from their eyes and so is his regained sureness of life such a concealed man who instinctively needs speech for silence and for burial in silence and who is inexhaustible in his evasion of communication wants and sees to it that a mask of him roams in his place through the hearts and heads of his friends and supposing he did not want it he would still realize some day that in spite of that a mask of him is there and that this is well every profound spirit needs a mask even more around every profound spirit a mask is growing continually owing to the constantly false namely shallow interpretation of every word every step every sign of life he gives one has to test oneself to see that one is destined for independence and command and do it at the right time one should not dodge one s tests though they may be the most dangerous game one could play and are tests that are taken in the end before no witness or judge but ourselves not to remain stuck to a person not even the most loved every person is a prison also a nook not to remain stuck to a fatherland not even if it suffers most and needs help most it is less difficult to sever one s heart from a victorious fatherland not to remain stuck to some pity not even for higher men into whose rare torture and helplessness some accident allowed us to look not to remain stuck to a science even if it should lure us with the most precious finds that seem to have been saved up precisely for us not to remain stuck to one s own detachment to that voluptuous remoteness and strangeness of the bird who flees ever higher to see ever more below him the danger of the flier not to remain stuck to our own virtues and become as a whole the victim of some detail in us such as our hospitality which is the danger of dangers for superior and rich souls who spend themselves lavishly almost indifferently and exaggerate the virtue of generosity into a vice one must know how to conserve oneself the hardest test of independence a new species of philosophers is coming up i venture to baptize them with a name that is not free of danger as i unriddle them insofar as they allow themselves to be unriddled for it belongs to their nature to want to remain riddles at some point these philosophers of the future may have a right it might also be a wrong to be called attempters this name itself is in the end a mere attempt and if you will a temptation are these coming philosophers new friends of truth that is probable enough for all philosophers so far have loved their truths but they will certainly not be dogmatists it must offend their pride also their taste if their truth is supposed to be a truth for every man which has so far been the secret wish and hidden meaning of all dogmatic aspirations my judgment is my judgment no one else is easily entitled to it that is what such a philosopher of the future may perhaps say of himself one must shed the bad taste of wanting to agree with many good is no longer good when one s neighbor mouths it and how should there be a common good the term contradicts itself whatever can be common always has little value in the end it must be as it is and always has been great things remain for the great abysses for the profound nuances and shudders for the refined and in brief all that is rare for the rare need i still say expressly after all this that they too will be free very free spirits these philosophers of the future though just as certainly they will not be merely free spirits but something more higher greater and thoroughly different that does not want to be misunderstood and mistaken for something else but saying this i feel an obligation almost as much to them as to ourselves who are their heralds and precursors we free spirits to sweep away a stupid old prejudice and misunderstanding about the lot of us all too long it has clouded the concept free spirit like a fog in all the countries of europe and in america too there now is something that abuses this name a very narrow imprisoned chained type of spirits who want just about the opposite of what accords with our intentions and instincts not to speak of the fact that regarding the new philosophers who are coming up they must assuredly be closed windows and bolted doors they belong briefly and sadly among the levelers these falsely so called free spirits being eloquent and prolifically scribbling slaves of the democratic taste and its modern ideas they are all human beings without solitude without their own solitude clumsy good fellows whom one should not deny either courage or respectable decency only they are unfree and ridiculously superficial above all in their basic inclination to find in the forms of the old society as it has existed so far just about the cause of all human misery and failure which is a way of standing truth happily upon her head what they would like to strive for with all their powers is the universal green pasture happiness of the herd with security lack danger comfort and an easier life for everyone the two songs and doctrines which they repeat most often equality of rights and sympathy for all that suffers and suffering itself they take for something that must be abolished we opposite men having opened our eyes and conscience to the question where and how the plant man has so far grown most vigorously to a height we think that this has happened every time under the opposite conditions that to this end the dangerousness of his situation must first grow to the point of enormity his power of invention and simulation his spirit had to develop under prolonged pressure and constraint into refinement and audacity his life will had to be enhanced into an unconditional power will we think that hardness forcefulness slavery danger in the alley and the heart life in hiding stoicism the art of experiment and devilry of every kind that everything evil terrible tyrannical in man everything in him that is kin to beasts of prey and serpents serves the enhancement of the species man as much as its opposite does indeed we do not even say enough when we say only that much and at any rate we are at this point in what we say and keep silent about at the other end from all modem ideology and herd desiderata as their antipodes perhaps is it any wonder that we free spirits are not exactly the most communicative spirits that we do not want to betray in every particular from what a spirit can liberate himself and to what he may then be driven and as for the meaning of the dangerous formula beyond good and evil with which we at least guard against being mistaken for others we are something different from librespenseurs liberi pensatori freidenker and whatever else all these goodly advocates of modern ideas like to call themselves at home or at least having been guests in many countries of the spirit having escaped again and again from the musty agreeable nooks into which preference and prejudice youth origin the accidents of people and books or even exhaustion from wandering seemed to have banished us full of malice against the lures of dependence that lie hidden in honors or money or offices or enthusiasms of the senses grateful even to need and vacillating sickness because they always rid us from some rule and its prejudice grateful to god devil sheep and worm in us curious to a vice investigators to the point of cruelty with uninhibited fingers for the unfathomable with teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible ready for every feat that requires a sense of acuteness and acute senses ready for every venture thanks to an excess of free will with fore and back souls into whose ultimate intentions nobody can look so easily with fore and backgrounds which no foot is likely to explore to the end concealed under cloaks of light conquerors even if we look like heirs and prodigals arrangers and collectors from morning till late misers of our riches and our crammed drawers economical in learning and forgetting inventive in schemas occasionally proud of tables of categories occasionally pedants occasionally night owls of work even in broad daylight yes when it is necessary even scarecrows and today it is necessary namely insofar as we are born sworn jealous friends of solitude of our own most profound most midnightly most middaily solitude that is the type of man we are we free spirits and perhaps you have something of this too you that are coming you new philosophers'"
